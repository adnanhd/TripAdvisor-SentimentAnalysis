0	0	Too small! Also this is not a city.	The cave was kind of interesting but tour guide didn't know much about it's origins. I am pretty tall and i couldn't stand up for the majority of the tour due to low ceilings and i had to crab walk through some of the passages just to get through. Not a good tour for large, tall or elderly people.  Also this is NOT a city. It is a refuge. Basically a bunch of small rooms joined by smaller tunnels. No large impressive areas.	2022-01	3	1	1
1	1	Fascinating but physically demanding	Derinkuyu is a fascinating underground city that is worth a visit while in Cappadocia. However be warned that the experience can be physically strenuous due to the need to ascend and descend steep and narrow staircases going down as far as 85m (approx. 300ft) underground. A tall person like myself did a range of minor damage with bruises and scratches to my head.	2022-01	4	1	0
2	2	Visit before Kaymakli or skip it	Derinkuyu is the biggest underground town in the area, however I wasn't that impressed with it. Maybe because we visited Kaymakli first which is smaller but far more interesting with much more rooms and tunnels than Derinkuyu.Both of them had similar purpose - to provide shelter for people living above them. They could accommodate around 20.000 people with their live stock, food supplies, water, etc...Be informed that visiting both of them requires good health and mobility conditions, as there're many steps, narrow passageways with reduced height and uneven terrain.	2021-08	3	1	1
3	3	Worth a visit.	Very enjoyable - but really intense... Narrow passageways and you go really far down. I was ok with most of it but the graves - wow that was spooky. We did this underground city after the one in Kayamalki - which was a good order. Because we did in this order we did not get a guide - we think this was a good way to do it!	2021-07	5	1	1
4	4	Unique as can be	If you want a unique experience, then any of Cappadocia's underground cities will fill the bill. The fact that Derinkuyu exists at all is amazing. I highly recommend it... just watch your head, as many of the passageways are so small you have to bend over in half to get through. Not for the claustrophobic or faint of heart.	2021-03	5	1	1
5	5	Unique experience if you are in historical places	We went there in march it's a 1 hour ride from goreme it's a unique experience how people used to live underground it's has 6 floors pathways are very small and narrow you have to bend down to cross it some area you have to sit and walk to get to the other side would recommend it if you are in to historical places but if any one is claustrophobic than I wouldn't recommend them as it's very small and narrow.	2021-03	4	1	1
6	6	Good footing	This seems to be a more established underground city in the area: well-defined paths with what felt like sterilized spaces. Seemed less interesting than Kaymakli underground city, but also less claustrophobic with larger spaces and more lighting.	2020-11	3	1	1
7	7	Dont waste time or money	Visited both underground cities in one day.   For 100 lira, this is not worth it.  Go down a lot of stairs and come out in a couple large rooms but that was it.  You dont get to go down 8 different stories and look at different rooms.  We were there for 15 minutes and really had seen everything there was to see.	2020-08	2	1	1
8	8	Great Underground City Experience	If you want to do some underground city exploration, this is a great place to visit. Many rooms, passageways, and tunnels to traverse and photograph, and good exercise as well! :) This is said to be the deepest underground city in Cappadocia, and I counted 220 steps from the lowest to the highest point, but of course there are many other stairways involved if you desire to poke around.	2020-07	5	1	1
9	9	Don’t Miss if you are in Cappadocia	Been there twice and did not feel any less excited even second time. One of the marvels of ancient world which takes you hundreds of years back in time.	2020-02	5	1	0
10	10	Largest Underground City in Cappadocia	The hugest underground city being discovered in Capaddocia 1. The tour guide told us that this Derinkuyu Underground city is the hugest underground city being discovered in Capaddocia. Though there is more to discover.2. If you are afraid of tight space or you have breathing problem, it is not a good place for you to visit. 3. Do you know that this underground city can shelter 20,000 people? 4. Do you know that this underground city is built more than 1200 years ago? 5. Definitely worth your time travelling and you would not regret.	2020-01	5	1	1
11	11	Enjoyed the visit	Derinkuyu underground city is a must visit if in Cappadocia. It gives an incredible glimpse into the lives, struggles, triumph and ingenuity of the people there. Take a guided tour if possible, it will help understand the place much better. Visit only if you are ready to walk inside narrow tunnels because the city is narrow and can be quite claustrophobic. If you don't suffer from claustrophobia, do visit!	2019-09	5	1	1
12	12	Quite Remarkable	This is a must visit and earlier in the day, the better. We were advised by our hotel manager to get there as soon as the place opened up to avoid crowds so we got there at 9:00 am. We were the first ones to enter the place and there were no other tourists in sight. Once were done buses full of tourists were arriving. We went down into the city with a guide that we acquired by the ticket office and were glad we did in order to understand and appreciate the history. It is remarkable to know that the entire Kappadokiya region has multiple underground cities, this one clearly is the best one in terms of the area.  It can be quite strenuous for those suffering from hypertension, obesity, and claustrophobia.	2019-10	5	1	1
13	13	Deepest Underground City in Cappadocia	The Derinkuyu underground city is a multi-level ancient refuge about 40 kilometers from Goreme, in Nevşehir Province. Out of the 36 known underground cities in the Cappadocia region, Derinkuyu is the deepest, extending to approximately 60 metres depth. It is large enough to have sheltered as many as 20,000 people, together with their livestock and food stores. Navigating its labirinth tunnels and learning about the ancient people's survival drive is one unforgettable experience, not to be passed.	2019-06	5	1	1
14	14	Amazing underground tour	One of the 38 known Anatolian underground cities.  The tour goes to 8 levels of construction.  Not for the claustrophobic.  An amazing walk through history offering a unique insight into another time and place in Turkish history.  Can get really crowded in peak season or on busy days.	2019-10	5	1	1
15	15	Big underground city	Thousands of people and their animals could hide here during times of unrest. 36 such cities and a couple claim to be the largest. Better for shorter fitter prople	2019-10	4	1	1
16	16	Much better than Kaymakli. If possible do on your own.	PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU ARE CLAUSTROPHOBIC.We did a green tour in Goreme and we were promised that we will be taken to Derinkuyu underground city as part of the tour. But when the tour was halfway through we were told that we are going to Kaymakli. I am not sure what was the reason for this change. May be because a lot of people in our group were elderly and Derinkuyu is certainly much more deeper and complicated than Kaymakli.Anyway, we had 1 day spare in Goreme and decided to go to Derinkuyu underground city through public transport. One huge advantage of using public transport is that you can choose a time later in the evening when there are not many tourists who are part of green tours. We took a mini bus from Goreme to Nevsehir for 4 Lira per person and then from Nevsehir to Derinkuyu village for 9 Lira per person. The bus stand in Derinkuyu is right in front of the entrance to the underground city. The mini buses are usually punctual and they run every 15 minutes from Nevsehir.The entrance fees is 42 Lira per person and it is also included in the museum card. This city is much more deeper and narrower than Kaymakli, making it much more adventurous. There are so many small tunnels here and if you are not in group, you can explore every inch of the city at your own pace. We really enjoyed it much more than Kaymakli.While coming back the frequency of mini buses to Nevsehir is one hour. In worst case you might have to wait for an hour at the bus station. But the small village of Derinkuyu is also very fascinating and you can walk through the village in the evening. The life here is so laid back and in sharp contrast with the life in big cities in Turkey. Even Goreme would seem like a big city when you walk through the Derinkuyu.	2019-10	5	1	0
17	17	Think twice before entering	Wow this was really fascinating. An underground village As we went in September there were no crowds. We were basically alone with our guide. We saw kitchens, storage areas, and family rooms. Unfortunatelly I was not able to go down to the next level due to my claustrophobia but from what I was told it was very impressive although a bit scary because of the narrow passages,	2019-09	4	1	0
18	18	Nightmare!	Started badly seeing the huge queues waiting to get in.When we did finally enter it was so crowded with the tour bus brigade it was impossible to move.The ceilings are low and the corridors narrow.After 10 minutes decided we had had enough, and were certainly not going to spend a couple of hours down there, and struggled to get out.If you are under 5.5 ft, and love crowds, you will like. Avoid otherwise.There are other, less well known, cities to explore.	2019-10	2	1	0
19	19	Not worth the effort	I’m probably one of the fews who will not recommend this place wholeheartedly. The history of this place is fascinating but you will not get much from visiting this place. The sites are not that big as it used to host around 20,000 people. I’m not sure if it worths the trip from Goreme.If you happened in the area and decided to visit this site, make sure you read and get to know about this place. Otherwise, it will just be a ‘cave’ for you and a waste of time.	2019-09	3	1	1
20	20	Claustrophobics (and people who have seen the movie The Descent), beware	As the name of the place suggests, this is an underground city that has been found some time ago (we didn't see any information there regarding the exact date).What is amazing about it (and not necessarily commonly known) is that after all excavations are done, it is expected that the underground city system may span 600+kms in length (at least this is what was told to us there).With that picture in mind, you can very well use the Derinkuyu Underground City as a starting point to imagine what it could’ve been like.The underground city is 85m deep, but you can only go down to a depth of 55m when exploring it. Basically you have access to roughly 10% of the entire city, but it is enough to see a stable, a church, a school, a winery, a well, residential areas, etc. As such, it still is pretty impressive.You really do get a feel for how they must’ve lived down there, which is nothing less than exhilarating.Two pro tips for this attraction: 1. Be wary about getting a tour guide on the spot, as some of them can rip you off and charge 100 EUR+. Consider not getting a tour guide as majority of the rooms are anyway with signs concerning what they were used for, or negotiate to pay much-much less.2. If you are very tall or are not so fit, be prepared. Some of the tunnels leading between areas are quite narrow, tight and with low ceilings. At 175 cm, some of us already had to walk squatting for quite lengthy distances to fully explore it.	2019-09	5	1	1
21	21	Amazing experience	There is nothing else like this that we've seen in our many travels. Taking a guide at the entrance, for about 120 TL, is worth it to understand what you're seeing. The kids had so much fun exploring all the galeries. Going to Cappadocia, you can't miss this!	2019-09	5	1	0
22	22	A thrilling visit.	I enjoyed my visit to this underground city. I have never experienced a place like this before and it left me wondering about the kind of life the people there would have led during the periods that they occupied the place. Only a part of the city is open to visitors and the lower levels are not properly marked. So you are left wondering about the usages of the many chambers etc.. Walking hunched up through the low narrow tunnels not knowing just how much further you would have to walk like this was mildly scary and I loved it all.	2019-08	5	1	1
23	23	42 TRY to see nothing - skip It	My strong advise: Skip this place - even if you are taken here by your tour guide. We were here on our own - driving from Göreme made it even less recommendable.It costs 42 TRY - 7 EUR to get in and you will be stuck in the tunnels with hundreds of other people trying to get in or out. You need to use the same stairs for going down & coming up and you need to wait it the tunnels for the very large tour groups to come up before you can go down. And once down at the bottom level you have to wait again with hundreds of other people to get back up. It is very crammed experience. There is nothing to see it the tunnels - just tunnels and bit larger ‘rooms’. It might be worth seeing if the tunnels were one way only - but as it is - the place is just a tourist rip-off.	2019-08	2	1	0
24	24	Worth a quick visit	We were part of a tour and the underground city was included. The information provided on the site was quite different then what you could read online, but I’ll let you be the judge of that.It goes without saying that people with claustrophobia should avoid getting in since some tunnels are narrow and you enter / exit from different points.	2019-08	4	1	1
25	25	Worth to visit	It is amazing to see an underground city that has been built many many centuries ago! It is definitely worth to visit. There are really small corridors so make sure you are physically fit to crouch and walk. You do not need a tour guide, just read the panel at the gate right by the ticket office and you know what you'd see. Overall, highly recommend this little journey!	2019-08	5	1	1
26	26	A brief visit ...	We had an eventful visit - a party of 6, 2 under 12, 2 over 60, and 2 in the middle.  Amazing to appreciate what folks did 2000 years ago.  We entered with a guide - things began well enough... but quickly turned for the worse after 15 minutes.  There aren’t a lot of descriptions of what you’re seeing so a guide is helpful.  And if your spouse has a claustrophobia induced panic attack the guide is invaluable in finding you the fastest way out.  Kids enjoyed it.  Grandparents were a little uncomfortable.  Wife HATED it.  Your mileage may vary.	2019-08	3	1	1
27	27	Running out of superlatives	Amazing place and amazing experience. I only wish I was a very young boy again and we had freedom to run and play in these tunnels. What sheer ingenuity the creators had, these became the home, the food store, the animals store, their prisons, meeting places, wineries, everything. They would live in these cave systems for weeks at a time if they were under attack. This at one time (with the as yet undiscovered tunnels) was home to around 20,000 people. With 20,000 peoples needs in terms of food, hygiene and also your internal compass being cut off from the ground and light source for weeks at a time. They believe that they have only discovered maybe 20% of all the cave systems.	2019-05	5	1	0
28	28	Nice	It’s nice, but not unmissable. It’s not as claustrophobic as we thought it would be, it’s interesting to see the hallways and rooms, but there’s not much else.	2019-06	4	1	1
29	29	Amazing underground city	If you visit Cappadocia, do not miss place. You go down 8 stories. The tunnels are petty narrow. And sometime you need to wait for others or squeeze in. If you are claustrophobic, it may be a little scary. But we visited with two children (ages 8 and 10), and had no problems. It was pretty amazing actually.	2019-06	5	1	1
30	30	Underground Maze	We went to Derinkuyu while we were staying in Goreme. It is a bit of a drive. Somewhere around 40 minutes each way. Taxis are not that expensive but when you compare the fare, for both ways, and the exhibit price, it would be cheaper to go on a tour bus. I do not like being in big tour groups so we decided to go on our own. The underground city is huge and there is a lot of history. However, after a few rooms it really starts to look all the same. It is easy to get lost because everywhere looks so similar. I do recommend that you go but I also recommend that you plan something else for the day as Derinkuyu is good, but also repetitive.	2019-04	3	1	1
31	31	Derinkuyu Underground City	This city is impressive, it is the deepest of over 200 in the area, I managed to get down to level 6 but there were more not all investigated as yet. It was an enjoyable place to visit although if you have walking difficulty I would not advise it. We were told by a guide that this city, and all the others, were built by Christians fleeing the Roman army? ( if you have the worlds best killing machine on your  tail I would suggest you would not stop to dig holes in the ground). I believe it was built around the end of the last ice age or earlier. IT does not make sense to make the effort to build these cities unless the surface was uninhabitable and that would be around the time of the Younger Dryas event. or earlier. I fully recommend a visit to this place it's special but the walking surface is uneven and slippery and there are lots of sharp stone corners.	2018-07	5	1	1
32	32	Little maze	You can enjoy little maze here. If you travel with children, please be cautious of some sharp stone, slippery stone floor and getting lost.	2019-05	3	1	1
33	33	Very Impressive Underground City	We made a visit to the Derinkuyu Underground City as part of the Green Tour for 33 euros per person.  The entrance fee was included in our tour.  Our guide explained the Underground City but there were quite a number of groups in front of us and behind us so we had to keep moving.We spent around an hour underground.  When you are underground, be prepared to crouch in the tunnels and you won't be able to stand up straight in some areas.  But definitely not as cramped as the Cu chi tunnels in Vietnam.It is an expansive underground city.  I was quite impressed.	2019-04	5	1	1
34	34	Worth a visit !!!	After buying entry ticket on our way inside we took a tour guide which I personally think a necessity. He took us all the way to few levels down explaining the history behind the underground city about thousands of ancient dwellers ( where the rich and poor lived)Taking us through narrow tunnels downwards quite a experience showing us where they used to make wine, storage, Bedrooms and much more about their living style. A must visit while in Cappadocia..	2019-03	4	1	1
35	35	Not to be missed!	This was clearly one of the highlights of our trip. You don’t wanna miss this one since it’s a different experience from all the breathtaking views you’ll get or hiking experiences that you’ll have in Cappadocia. We went alone as a couple due to lack of time but in my opinion a guided tour would be a more fulfilling experience.	2019-03	5	1	0
36	36	Good but extremely way too crowded	We went to this underground city a day before going to Kaymakli underground city, unfortunately for us it wasn’t the best moment because we visited it on the very last day of a big holiday in Turkey and many locals were here and it was impossible to walk through the narrow passages of this place.Even a few times the workers there were helping people to transit and we had to wait for the next groups turn to keep going.Just make sure what day are you travelling here and check is not a big holiday in Turkey, otherwise you might struggle a lot.The place was nice and deeper than Kaymakli but my favorite was Kaymakli I couldn’t even take photos from this city because it was impossible and too crowded	2018-08	4	1	1
37	37	Fascinating ...	It was breathtaking experience and very difficult to imagine how years ago, without any machine aid, people manged to built such an architectural marvel. From proper ventilation to storage to grave, it had everything.  'A must to visit' during Cappadocia trip.	2019-01	5	1	1
38	38	Pretty Cool	This was an unusual experience. I completely enjoyed it. Fascinating that people could do this without tools, and use it for safety and defense. I spent about an hour there, and enjoyed the occasional challenge to get unto a new level or room. Glad I had someone who could tell me about it as I go. That increased the experience a lot. Don't get lost... Was not busy when we went.	2018-12	4	1	1
39	39	Don't miss this!	What an amazing place to visit wow! It's a must on your list. It's incredible to think how this city was built without the aid of machines. It does go down about 200 ft with many rooms and corridors. There was a lady on my tour who suffered claustrophobia but was totally fine with the decent. It is mind blowing to see the detail and planning that went into this city. I did it as part of The Green Tour, well worth it. And I was lucky to be part of a small group, about 15 and the guide was really entertaining and informative.	2018-10	5	1	1
40	40	An ancient wonder	The underground city was so interesting and slightly strenuous as you had to climb through the narrow pathways up and down the underground city. Fascinating to see how people lived in ancient times, communicating with each other via old school methods.	2018-12	5	1	1
41	41	DERINKUYU UNDERGROUNDCity	We visit it as a part of Green tour With a great guide which is recommended for this kind of tour, i woud not recomend to do this tour alone to anyone.Nice experience..	2018-12	5	1	1
42	42	unusual place to live	Narrow tangled  tunnels, strange  sleeping rooms, school, church, stables, all you need for normal life, but all underground. For me it was an extraordinary experience!	2018-08	4	1	0
43	43	Impressive history behind these underground tunnels	These tunnels are pretty impressive - they show how people prepared themselves for potential invasions and how they thought about every detail - they had place for their animals, kitchens, living rooms, everything! They were fully prepared for attacks by enemies. When I got there and went several levels underground I couldn't stop thinking how much effort this must have taken the people to build these tunnels. Some things to consider: In some places the tunnels are very narrow and it might get claustrophobic. Another problem (which was exttemelly annoying for me and the reason why I didn't put 5 stars) is that it gets pretty crowded especially with big groups. Better choose early morning for your visit.	2018-10	4	1	1
44	44	A must visit in Cappadocia area!	We were brought here as part of the green tour. You will be amazed at how the people from the 10th century stayed in these tiny underground cave. If you are highly claustrophobic, limited mobility or traveling with small children, I wouldn't recommend this visit. Otherwise, all healthy adults should try this out.	2018-11	5	1	0
45	45	New experience	The place is entertaining and claustrophobic, many levels and hidden paths with rooms, good for and hour visit.It’s a self guided visit, but there are guides in the entrance if you are interested in getting an explanation on what you are seeing, in this place it might be worth it since you will not get any clarification or signs on what’s displayed or the use of the rooms. And I don’t usually use guides.	2018-11	4	1	1
46	46	Interesting visit	The underground city was very interesting, so much history to absorb. The way it was built and the design itself is quite remarkable. I thoroughly enjoyed my trip to the underground city.	2018-11	5	1	1
47	47	Must do caves	These are the caves where 25000 people used to live for protection from enemies.these are caves where you descend from one room to another and you hardly know that you are descending floors, except in one or two areas. Light and air is good you do not feel uncomfortable in this. Just keep calm and try to live in the moment and experience or imagine the life in olden days.	2018-10	5	1	1
48	48	Dungeons and dungeons, tunnels to the deepest mystery	One of the best thing you should do in cappadocia, it’s a very interesting experience to discover how people here used to live underground, honestly, there is nothing here left in the underground caves, no painting, crafting or even any furniture, still walking down to 7th floor underground is a unique experience you wont have anywhere else, if you are a cave lover than you don’t want to miss this. At least visit one of the underground city here. It’s very easy to take the bus and come here by yourself, there isn’t much difference, but if you like you can also spend some time to visit kaymakli underground city as well! It’s about 10km from here, and most bus will pass through there as well!	2018-10	5	1	0
49	49	Thrilling underground city visits	This was the biggest surpise of our trip to Cappadocia. Going through all the tunnels leading to the various levels of ancient civilisation and learning unique things about the civilisation will make this trip a great experience. Please note this is not recommended for those who feel claustrophobic.	2018-10	5	1	1
50	50	Wonderful experience of ancient caves	this experience should not be missed.However be warned it needs a lot of climbing up and down long stairs with very low ceilings,  so don't go in far if you have knee problems or bad back problems. Also don't go in smart clothes unless you mind a bit of dust possibly getting on your clothesthere are many levels in here, it's stunning, I've not seen anything similar outside this area	2018-05	5	1	0
51	51	Interesting place...	this place is not for claustrophonic, some passage way specially going to the lowest levelwould require bending on a narrow incline tunnel. Not for people with heart problem sometimes you need to climb faster as some passageway are only one way and other groups are waiting for their turn  to go down but in general if you well fit its worth a visit. It would be wiser to explore it with a guide...	2018-08	5	1	1
52	52	Amazing place to see	After i read the reviews here, i was worry because of my height. Since i m 190cm. However, it wasn’t that hard to navigate around. Once u pass tunnels or stairs rooms were spacious. It takes about 45min tour.	2018-09	5	1	0
53	53	Very interesting.	Built over hundreds of years and multi levels, this cave system is worth seeing.  Gives a real interesting insight to how people hid in times of crisis and sheltered from the heat and cold.  If you are obese you might have trouble getting through these narrow passages.  You don’t need to be especially fit, as you can go though at your own pace, and don’t need to go to the lowest levels if you don’t want to.	2018-08	5	1	0
54	54	Very interesting underground city!	We visited here on the recommendation of our guidebook and were not disappointed.  As stated in other reviews, this is not for those with heart problems or claustrophobia.  There were loads of very narrow and steep stairs as well as low ceiling heights in many areas.  Overall highly recommend this experience though as it very interesting!	2018-08	5	1	1
55	55	Surprising defence system.	"There are many underground cities in the area it is important to note that people did not live in them. They were means of defence and escape from enemies.These were places of refuge from the Romans in the very early Christian Era before Constantine. In design this ""city"" had seven levels decending through the volcanic rock, narrow runnels, air shafts, storage areas, round basalt rock doors, a church and wells all cut by hand over the centuries. It has narrow steep stairs and low tunnels all designed for defence. This means a torch, a relatively good level of fitness are required. I recommend a good guide as some passages and stairways are one way and these can get very busy with tour groups. We were lucky enough to have Erogan who had taken us through the outdoor museum. Again his expertise and knowledge meant we had a truly interesting learning experience."	2018-07	5	1	1
56	56	Strange Underground City!	A unique and concluded place! You can navigate around the city via narrow tunnels with painstaking designs. Note that the  ceiling can be low at times, so watch out for your head. The atmosphere inside the city is cool even in the apex and heat in the middle of summer. Definitely a must visit.	2018-07	5	1	1
57	57	Must visit	Had gone there early this june.. Its a wonderful place full of history.. We had excellent guide called denise with us.. He was a powerhouse of information.. And i felt truly amazed after getting into this underground city.. So much planning n hard work has gone into constructing it.. Hats off.. Its a gem	2018-06	5	1	1
58	58	Wonderful place	Visited during our stay in Goreme. Did not opt for a guide, just went around ourselves. It was a unique and wonderful experience.There are a number of levels inside and it was very enjoyable. Was not stuffy inside but some areas can be a bit difficult for those who are claustrophobic.Have to bend down a lot at some places as the roof can be very low.Highly recommended to those who may be comfortable doing it. Not something which we can experience at other places.	2018-05	5	1	1
59	59	Definetly yes	Ok we went to Ozkonak Underground City, they charged us 10 TL for a very small place. Then on our way back home, we did take time to visit this amazing, huge place.  They charge you 25TL and it way well woth it.  If you follow the arrows inside it will take you 30 mins or so, but if you wonder around the other un marked tunnels (which you can, if you like to take the chance, we did just a little bit) it might take you alot longer. It was like they had a underground city under this one. So so amazing.	2018-07	5	1	0
60	60	not for the faint hearted	we visited this place on a tour and would have liked a lot longer to explore. due to the narrow passage ways and stairs I would not recommend for the claustrophobic or faint hearted,the history and complexity of the work and effort to dig this so that many people could live here to retreat from, enemies wildlife and the extremes of the heat in summer and cold and snow in winter is fantastic, it is believed that this place was once linked with tunnels to 7 other underground cities in the area. one of the main points is a very deep well, which was used for water, but i believe that because of the size of this must have been used as a winch to lower food and supplies into the city and to take out waste and rubble. we visited on a guided tour and which included the 25tl entrance fee which was very informative but found to be a little rushed as this place can get very busy. if i was to visit again i would like to do it on my own and purchase a guide book then do at a more leisurly pace.	2018-06	5	1	1
61	61	Interesting	An interesting place to explore with a rich history and many turns and twists. Although not all of the underground city is open for visitation there is enough here to see - cavernous rooms, places to crawl into and large stones that were used as doors. It is a unique experience and one that is slightly physically demanding (steep, narrow stairs in places). Take some warm clothes for the deeper levels, pace yourself and watch your head.	2018-06	4	1	1
62	62	Deep well!	we did derinkyu underground city tour with cappadocian guide company. Kadir was our guide and he's exceptionally good. Carry a small bag as it gets difficult to navigate if you have a big bag on your shoulder. Also lot of climbing and walking so Ppl with knee or back issues should be watchful. We were amazed seeing the skills ppl had at that time. So well thought about! The ventilation shaft, living room and storage room is fascinating! Only 8 percent is accessible and at one point we were standing 50 ft below the earth's surface. Our guide told us interesting facts like the rooms alloted in the underground city was as per number of Ppl and not order of the the person. A king may not necessarily get a bigger room. He also told us that if a bride to be wishes to say no for marriage then she should spike the grooms coffee with salt or spice! Thoroughly enjoyed the tour and it's a must do in cappadocia. We had some amazingly strong turkish coffee outside the city. The souvenirs available at the shop were good too.	2018-06	5	1	1
63	63	Amazing and challenging	Derinkuyu is one of those places you wouldn't believe exists if you hadn't actually been there.Let me make an important point not just about Derinkuyu, but about many sites and attractions in Turkey: you get unbelievable hands-on access at almost every museum and historical site, Derinkuyu included.Which means, at Derinkuyu, you will be walking carefully down steep rock stairways underground, squeezing through tiny dark passages, and if you are the least bit claustrophobic or unable to negotiate strenuous climbs, you probably shouldn't even try.Derinkuyu is an underground city that Christians, and Hittites before them, would retreat into when enemies attacked.The passages and rooms stretch for kilometers underground on multiple levels, going far deeper than the first twenty to thirty meters below ground open for the tour.Entering one small room from a narrow passage, I moved to a corner where no one was standing. Unfortunately, my eyes hadn't adjusted to the darkness of the room and I didn't see that the corner had no one standing in it because it was a burial pit. I fell in, bruising my arm and dignity, but was not seriously hurt. Yet it was a warning to me, and I hope to others, not to take safety for granted while in Derinkuyu. The guides and signs describe one amazing room as a schoolroom, but with a pool for a baptistry part of the room and an elevated speaking position at one end, I'm certain that it was used as a church. By all means, visit Derinkuyu. You will be glad you did. But be careful....	2018-05	5	1	0
64	64	Interesting place and an unique experience	It is quite an interesting place to visit. One does wonder how many families including their cattle could live for days together there. The entrance and entries are quite narrow but the ventilation is quite good. Persons are allowed to go in batches of 10-15 person so that the places do not get overcrowded. Don't carry backpacks as you may have to bend and almost crawl at some locations. Some passages have to be used in both directions but there are ushers to make sure that there is always people moving in only one direction at a time. An unique experience one should not miss out.	2018-05	4	1	1
65	65	Interesting experience!	Definitely don't go if you're claustrophobic - not just because there are small corridors and well, you're underground - but also because there are large groups of Turkish school children that come in and bust through the passageways causing holdups of 10-50 people in very small compartments.  That aside, the experience was pretty interesting! Multiple levels, areas where animals were kept and fed, kitchens, bedrooms. Very interesting.  Also, as a tip, because it is below ground the temperature is very even but a bit on the chilly side! Nice to escape the heat, but be prepared.	2018-05	4	1	1
66	66	Don't go if you are claustrophobic	Although this is an amazing place, a series of underground passages and rooms underground that housed (depending on who you believe) up to 35 000 people it is very cramped in places. You have to be prepared to crouch a fair bit to be able to move along the narrow corridors. The real trouble comes when you can't just carry on moving forward and have to retrace your steps. Then you have to wait while others move through, we got stuck in quite a small room. Definitely not for those who hate being in cramped places and are afraid of being crushed.	2018-05	4	1	0
67	67	Real cave experience	It’s a real cave experience. You need to have a strong back and good shoes to roam around the entire underground city. It looks claustrophobic but they have good ventilation system. Can’t believe people around six thousand years ago lived here. The stairs are extremely narrow and steep. It was like a hardcore work out to visit but but a great walk through ancient civilization	2018-04	5	1	1
68	68	Amazing!	You should go to this place in the morning to avoid the crowd of tourists.And I suggest you to bring a torch for more fun advenger!This underground city is so complex and truely amazing.Must visit!	2018-04	5	1	1
69	69	Go in the morning	It is a must see but beware if you are claustrophobic or have a heart condition. No sane authority would allow so many people into such narrow tunnels at the same time. Even though I am not claustrophobic and don’t have a heart condition, because of the crowd, I felt so overwhelmed and you wonder what would they do if someone collapses or some emergency or panic occurs in the tunnels. I don’t think they have a disaster plan. So if you will visit this place try to do it in the morning before the big groups arrive. You will love it and will be amazed.	2018-04	5	1	1
70	70	Watch out for tickets sales times!!! Closes at 16:15!	We drove 45 mins out of Goreme to come here thinking they close at 7 pm as per their website.We got there at 16:35. The tickets sales counter was already closed at 16:15! The security said the place is open but since we do not have a ticket we cannot go in. No discussion.We were not the only ones who were very disappointed we were leaving Goreme the same day. The website should be updated with such info.	2018-04	1	1	0
71	71	Absolutely Fascinating - Some tips	We got there for when it opened at 8am, and were the only 2 people there, which was fantastic. Some points to consider:- Go early if you can, to avoid the crowds, as some walkways can be narrow- A small torch is handy, as some areas are dark, particularly the tunnels.- While the walkways are narrow, (you'll just have to crouch a bit when walking) the ceilings of the rooms are relatively high, so these don't feel so claustrophobic.- It does get a bit nippy down there, so a light jacket is ideal. - Costs 25TL (bargain)- Super interesting experience and must see!	2018-03	5	1	1
72	72	incredible place	Goreme  open air museum is very close to Goreme village, so we went there by foot. The entrance fee was 100 tl, or 150 tl with guide. There is a museum shop where you can buy a book guide.It is an incredible place,used to be a monastery in early christian times with a lot of small churches inside of amazing stone formations.	2022-04	5	2	0
73	73	Good to visit - be careful with guides asking for bribes	The price is 100 TK Lira , but you have to pay extra for visiting things inside the museum ( like the Dark Church) The guides have a small scam !!! They do not want you to buy guide officialy at the gate but after they talk with you for a few minutes they will demand money. They will offer to take pictures for you then ask for money. There is a scam after every corner 😁	2022-04	3	2	0
74	74	Incredible place on Earth	After Petra, Jordan, this was always on my list and finally got to it this year!It is a marvelous display of natural rock formations and human ingenuity and titanic effort to chisel  habitats inside the belly of these strange stones not to mention the brute story of the reasons and believes that drove people to hide up here. Me and my friends spent the day of March 24 around. We hired a local guide for the Open-Air museum, very knowledge, easy going, well educated. The stories of the 7 churches are dazzling, it would be a pity to walk through them without any knowledge or info of their history. You need more than a day if you want to see the entire area, some dwellings and settlements are so far apart you need to drive to cover all that ground. In short, book at least 2 days to explore this amazing attraction. Anything less wont do any justice.	2022-03	5	2	1
75	75	Amazing view	A magnificient view speacially with the snow.. i loved the place it was very close to goreme where i stayed it was hard to climb for my 4 years old daughter but we did it the parking was 8 minutes away from the museum toilets were soo clean and the place was not crowded	2022-03	4	2	0
76	76	Great way to spend a few hours - Worth a visit	The open air museum is amazing and well worth a visit. The site is pretty much a small village carved out of the stone - complete with everything that you would need to live, so there's a little bit of everything, from stables to churches to kitchens etc, only its all part of ancient history.There's still frescos on the walls of some of the churches, unfortunately there has been a fair amount of damage/ vandalism that was obviously done on purpose - although you cant say by whom as 4 different peoples have occupied the area over the years.There's plenty of houses/dwellings and loads of Dining halls carved out of the rock - they obviously used to eat one hell of a lot. There's not a whole lot of information around so I would suggest the audio tour or a guide (but make sure to haggle).There's a lot of walking and its not the easiest if you have trouble with hills and dodgy stairs and passageways.Overall it was a great way to spend half a day.Entrance was 60TL and you needed to buy an extra ticket for one of the churches. Also the staff at the entrance/ticket booth were pretty rude and a bit idiotic.	2022-03	4	2	0
77	77	Beautiful	this is the most beautiful place i have ever seen during my traveling. I booked tour with an agency and they assigned us very nice and informative.	2022-03	5	2	1
78	78	Fairy Village	This is a must see. It's like a fairy or hobbit village. Very unique dwellings.  Interesting to see from different heights throughout the area.	2022-03	5	2	1
79	79	Good	it is very good place but due to very cold weather we was unable to enjoy too much. there was a small group with us and our guide took care of us.	2022-02	4	2	0
80	80	Amazing	Amazing but go with a guide who can tell you the history and explain the geology. It is def with a trip.	2022-02	4	2	1
81	81	Beauty	I don’t think there is anything more I can say about our visit to Cappadocia, Goreme. Unbelievable shapes and carved out cave entrances.	2022-01	5	2	0
82	82	amazing history	amazed by the place and its history, imagine living there in those times hundred of years ago. dont forget to visit the museum shop too.	2022-01	4	2	0
83	83	Very Cool	Such a cool museum. They had good information and the church drawings were very unique. Definitely check out the Dark Church too, it's worth the extra money.	2022-01	5	2	1
84	84	Worth a visit	We walked there from Goreme and toured the open air museum site learning about the historical area. As we went in July, I recommend bringing water, wearing sunscreen and a hat to protect against the sun. Sturdy walking shoes are a plus.  On the walk there and back, there are scenic views of the fairy chimneys.	2021-07	4	2	1
85	85	Like nowhere else on earth	Go early or in winter to escape the madding crowd. Very atmospheric place to explore the different caves and imagine life hundreds of years ago.	2021-12	5	2	0
86	86	Historical site	Open air museum is worth visiting especially if you are interested in visiting historical sites and learning about the human civilization	2021-12	4	2	1
87	87	Chapels In Caves	Interesting.  You’ll see several chapels carved into the rock.  Painted ceilings.  No photos allowed inside.  Sadly over the years they have been damaged by vandals, but still worth stopping in to see the beautiful and unusual sight.	2021-12	5	2	1
88	88	An Amazing Collection of Chapels	Although somewhat crowded (we were there on a weekend), this place is a great collection of chapels and monastery rooms that will have you wondering what it was like when active. Some amazing carvings out of the rock and religious paintings. We had a guide who helped put things in context.	2021-11	5	2	1
89	89	A visit to the museum	Went round the geological wonder. Very ancient. Seat of ancient Christianity. Very interesting to note the initial days of Christianity.	2021-10	5	2	1
90	90	A must for those interested in the history of the area	If you are interested in understanding the history of the area, then along with taking in an underground city this is a must.  A Unesco World Heritage site with ancient churches decorated with frescoes carved into the rock. The title open-air museum is a misnomer as the churches are obviously inside, you simply walk between them outside.  It is unfortunate that you have to pay extra on top of the general entrance fee to get into any church that has got a decent fresco,  hopefully the money all goes to upkeep. Also unfortunate that you cannot take pictures inside,  I could understand no flash but most cameras don't need it nowadays. [For those that are not interested in history or ticking off the local sights, I wouldn't fret if you can't get here].	2021-10	4	2	1
91	91	Nice but overpriced	After  day of a hiking I was wondering where all the tourists were. I discovered they were at the open air museum. It's a nice place but overpriced in my opinion when you can hike the valleys for free on your own. If you aren't a hiker then you will probably enjoy more than I did.	2021-10	3	2	1
92	92	Historical early Christian structures	Very interesting and informative museum. Great photo opportunities. Involves a bit of hiking and climbing. Unfortunately no indoor photos are permitted.	2021-10	5	2	1
93	93	One of world's best open air museums	"Goreme Open air museum is the most accessible one from the town of Goreme. It's a short drive from town with lot of parking spaces on site.Entrance fee is 100 TL, but it is included in the ""Museum Cappadocia Pass"" which I strongly suggest (saves you almost 50% on separate tickets).Goreme open air museum is famous for its Churches carved in rocks - there are around 15 of them and most of them you can enter. Bear in mind that touring it is pretty challenging with uneven terrain, rocks, steps, etc...not suitable for people with mobility issues.The Dark Church requires a small extra fee which is included if you have the Pass.Although there're ""No Photo"" signs, you can do that almost everywhere. In some churches frescoes are faded, while in some perfectly preserved considering their age.Count on around 1,5 to 2 hours for a proper visit."	2021-08	5	2	0
94	94	Beautiful churches	"We very much enjoyed this open-air museum - its very well kept, clean, with great views and several churches from the 10th to 12th century built into the rocks to visit. The paintings inside some of the churches (especially the ""apple church"") are really beautiful and considering the age, in very good condition. Dont miss the beautiful Tokali church, which is 50 meters down the road from the museum (entrance is included in your ticket).Dont visit on the weekend, as it gets really crowded then."	2021-09	4	2	1
95	95	Worth a visit in off season or rainy day	The museum was a very interesting place to visit. I loved the historic rock carved churches for the fantastical nature of their architecture alone. It's remarkable to think about them carving out these churches and houses from the rock. The admission fee was 100 lira just for the day pass with no frills, or about 10 euros. It was a fair price, however once inside we noticed that seemingly half or more of the churches and cave homes were roped off or had shuttered doors. It was raining during our visit, so we had the luxury of not much competition for the open spots.	2021-09	4	2	0
96	96	Interesting churches	All the churches were interesting and I was fascinated how they were built. Overall the experience was great . However,no pictures or videos were allowed to be taken inside them .	2021-09	4	2	1
97	97	NO PHOTOS / NO VIDEO	After paying 100 TL per person you will discover that all churches have big printed NO PHOTOS / NO VIDEO signs. Should this have been announced at the ticket office, we wouldn't have bothered. There are guards in each church to watch your phone/camera.I wonder if whoever makes these illogical decisions understands that tourists will still visit the place regardless of how many pictures can be found online. And no, in the digital age I will not buy your printed postcards, all you get is frustrated visitors that feel cheated.It's a tourist trap that benefits from being close to Goreme	2021-08	2	2	0
98	98	Not as expected, not worth the money	Expensive entrance fee parts were closed, then extra charge to the main attraction.Better places to visit of the beaten track with none or very little charge.	2021-08	2	2	1
99	99	Worth a visit	We enjoyed our visit but the highlight is the dark church-  which is the highlight - is visited only with an additional admission - unless you have the museum pass... Otherwise the churches are ok and interesting but not spectacular.	2021-07	4	2	1
100	100	An interesting historical place	Highly recommended for those interested in the history of this region. Makes one wonder how the inhabitants of this place managed to carve out their dwelling amongst these rock without the modern tools that are available. Some of the churches had intricate art work.	2021-02	4	2	1
101	101	not worth the money	I visited here due to it being so popular on Trip Advisor, however I am unsure why this is? Definitely not worth 100tl. Not all the rooms were open and an extra charge was  expected to pay for one of the churches. It took less than hour to walk around the whole place. I understand there is a lot of history at this place but in my opinion there is much better things to do in Cappadocia.	2021-05	1	2	1
102	102	Goreme outdoor museum	100TL for a walk around a few old rock churches, some were closed others you had to pay extra to see (dark church) took us 35 minutes to get around. Would not recommend unless you are really into religious history. Better to just go walking through the valleys which are beautiful.	2021-05	1	2	0
103	103	History	This Museum has amazing and wonderful sights. out tour guide told us everything about this place also the history of this museum. but the best part it liked is that is was not crowded at all. all the safety measures has been take	2021-05	4	2	1
104	104	Journey to the past	It is exciting to visit Goreme Open Air Museum with its historical pieces. The walk around is enjoyable with the fresh air.	2021-05	5	2	1
105	105	Amazing	The best place for visit and making photo. You need around 2-2.5 hours for visit, comfortable sport shoes	2021-05	5	2	1
106	106	The heart of Cappadocia	If you can only see one thing in Cappadocia (which... why would you do that?), then make it the Göreme Open Air Museum, which is just that: An area so packed with history that they have to just make the whole thing a museum. It doesn't take a whole long time to see, but what you see while you're there is overwhelming, an amazing blend of history, architecture, religion, art, nature, and geology.	2021-04	5	2	1
107	107	Top place to see in Göreme.	You absolutely MUST go to this museum while you’re in Cappadoccia. Get the audio tour! So much to see, in such amazing condition, and in such peaceful setting.	2021-04	5	2	1
108	108	Magnificent wonderful caves	Such a nice way to discover the wonders if Cappadocia! This open air museum is well maintained and you’ll visit many small churches with beautiful paintings. Book a guide if you can, we paid 100€ per day and it was excellent.  Spring or Autumn are the best seasons to visit this wonderful area	2021-04	5	2	1
109	109	Truly unique experience	What an incredible place! Totally worth the hike there! Caves painted with Christian motifs in such detail normally only to be seen in churches. One of a kind.	2021-04	5	2	1
110	110	Walk into History	Amazing history! To see churches that are over 1200 years old is rare. It brings you back to the Turkey that was the cradle of Christianity up until the Ottoman conquest. You get q sense of what it was like for the Christian's (St Basil) who lived in these mountains before Christianity was legalised in the Roman Empire. A lot of the 1000AD churches are dedicated to him. Lots of history to read as you go along, or you can get an audio or tour guide. The Dark Chapel is 25TL, but worth it. Some people are there just to take photos, which is fine too, as there are lots of great backdrops and views.	2021-04	5	2	1
111	111	Honeymoob	Sadly we were at the time when balloons didn't fly, but this place made our day, it is worth every penny	2021-03	5	2	0
112	112	Impressive early Christian churches	This is an amazing place for observing early Christian churches! The frescoes are very well preserved which makes the experience unforgettable if you are into the history and architecture. Architectural-wise those are just rocks and cliffs around - same as you can see everywhere around but inside the caves... These churches - Apple Church, Sandals Church and others are great. You need an additional ticket to visit the Dark Church but it is worth it. Also, don’t miss the biggest church of the complex - it is located outside the fence a little bit down the street. Getting there is just a short walk from the town center	2021-03	5	2	0
113	113	DO NOT USE:  AK BANK ATM'S....THEY CHARGE 7.8% IN ADDITIONAL FEES you don't see until you recieve your printed receipt.	I am very happy I came to Goreme in the Winter... This place is amazing!!! I want all visitors to know my POSITIVE &  NEGATIVE experiences.   FIRST THE NEGATIVE... DO NOT USE THE:  AK BANK ATM'S....THEY CHARGE 7.8% IN ADDITIONAL FEES you don't see until you recieve your printed receipt!!!!!!  SCAM! The small town is not only beautiful but everything you will come to need is conveniently within short walking distance.   Locals have decades of international traveler experience So are generally easy to work with. & all attractions are unique and spectacular.   If you visit Cappadocia / Goreme,  Avanos,  Kaymakli & Nevsehir,  it WILL BE AN UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE!  Stay away from the AK Bank  ATM's!!!	2021-01	5	2	1
114	114	beautiful	Extraordinary perspectives and amazing people. Be prepared for a climb. There is a little expense to enter yet it is justified, despite any trouble	2021-02	5	2	1
115	115	a must	Try to go early in the day to beat the crowds.  It's well worth it.  We were there in summer but if you go early you can beat the heat and crowds.	2020-02	5	2	1
116	116	Very coolto roam around	"Cappadocia-- Located in central Turkey is known for its distinctive "" fairy chimneys,"" tall, cone-shaped rock formations clustered in Göreme  and near by valleys. This by far has been one of my favorite places to visit, with a moon like landscape, underground cities, cave churches daiting back to the Byzantine era and houses carved in the rocks! This region took my breath away..."	2020-02	5	2	1
117	117	Great 😍	My favorite part was the camel tour 🐫The Camel tour in such beautiful place is a must. If you want to visit the church make sure u arrive before 3 pm Love it and recommend it to anyone who will visit Cappadocia	2021-01	5	2	1
118	118	Amazing People	I really enjoyed my tour. My tour guide was very good, he guided me for this all trip. Over all it was great	2021-01	5	2	1
119	119	Beatifull place, amazing frescos	A master piece in Capadoccia. An amazing place to start the tour in Capadoccia, as it wil both introduce you to the geological formation and also to amazing early christianity art. I HIGHLY recommend hiring the guides, as they you show easy to miss details of the building/caves and give a broader historical context of the area.	2020-12	5	2	1
120	120	Disappointing	We expected amazing and interesting walk as the most hyped location of Goreme, but in fact the reality is:- very expensive entrance fee (70 TL)- small territory- very industrial (you can see that a lot of things were reconstructed in a bad way, fences everywhere etc)Highly recommending to visit another open air museum - Zelve. It’s way bigger, and more interesting to walk and discover.	2020-12	3	2	1
121	121	Amazing place to visit	Amazing place to visit.  We opted to hire a guide to spend an hour showing us around, and then ended up hiring the same guide to take us to many of the other sites - in that we only had one day in the area and wanted to see as much as possible.  The history of this place is fascinating, and while some vandalism over the years is unfortunate, efforts have been made over the last couple decades to preserve and restore that which remains.	2020-12	5	2	1
122	122	Heritage church	It was ok .But not that much to see as many doors closed. And some area under renovation. Entry fees 75 TL. Plus 25 for audio guide.Extra 25 for dark church.	2020-12	3	2	0
123	123	Good tour	Great place to visit, but unfortunately the museum charges the visit to the main monument aside and is not possible to take photos inside. Regrettable this type of action to raise more money.	2020-12	3	2	1
124	124	MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL IN PERSON!	I feel like. pictures and videos don't do justice to this place at all!( Cappadocia in general). This is an awesome attraction for museum lovers and for people who don't like museums. It's a must do while in Cappadocia, in my opinion.	2020-11	5	2	1
125	125	Spend the extra for Dark Church	This collection of chapels is remarkable, but the jewel in the crown is most definitely the Dark Church: most complete and by far most detailed paintings in the area. A neat experience.	2020-11	4	2	1
126	126	Best place	This the best place in Turkey. Our tour guide told history about this to us. It is really great place and nice views	2020-11	5	2	1
127	127	Great Architecture	Had some amazing views and architecture if you are into religious history it is great and would be a must however it didn't particularly interest me personally. Price has increased for tickets as there was a sticker covering previous price. Current price is 75 lira per person. Also an extra fee was included if you wanted to see another part of it. Some of the ceiling and wall art in the churches had been written on unfortunately.	2020-11	3	2	1
128	128	history of  fairy chimneys	Goreme National Park, Cappadocia...natural wonder caves and fairy chimneys formed by lava gushing from volcanic mountains(hasandağı,erciyes,Göllüdağ-Melendiz) on top of tuff layers formed on the soil surface by adding new lava layers and rivers (kızılırmak,melendiz) and lakes and wind erosion in the region.The word cappadocia was first encountered in the inscription written on the rocks of the Behistan Mountain, which is located between the cities of Kermanshah and Hammam in 6th century BC.it is written here in the form of katpatuka.Hittites, Tabal kingdom, the late Hittite kingdom, Medes, Persians, Alexander the Great, Romans, Byzantines, Seljuks....Some sources say that in Persian it means the land of beautiful horses.It is known that horses raised in this region in ancient times were very famous and some emperors who conquered the region demanded horses as taxes.We know that this place was ruled by 2 governors (satraps) during the Persian period.(Taurus and Pontus Cappadocia)The oldest written historical source belonging to the Cappadocia region is mentioned in the work of the Amasya historian Strabo called geographika.Göreme Open Air Museum is a rock settlement area located 2 km east of Göreme town.Göreme open air museum, which is the most popular tourist attraction in the Cappadocia region, Many rock settlements, churches, monasteries, dining halls, chimneys and more ...Tokalı Kilise,Rahipler ve Rahibeler Manastırı,St. Basil Şapeli,Elmalı Kilise,Çavuşin Kilisesi,Yılanlı Kilise,Karanlık Kilise,Azize Catherine Şapeli,Çarıklı Kilise and numerous settlements can be seen in the open air museum.	2020-10	5	2	1
129	129	OK but expensive tickets even fit children	Just so so place .... You can see similar caves just outside in the next valley for free .... 75 Turkish Kira entrance fee for kids over 8 and adults	2020-11	3	2	0
130	130	Open Air Museum Stepping back in History	A must see when you go to Kapadokya and visit Goereme. Wonderful museum with all the cave churches and the wonderful landscape. You get more than a history lesson, it will be an experience for your life time.	2020-10	5	2	1
131	131	Disappointed with the visit	We visited Zelve Open Air Museum the day before, which is why the Goreme Open Air Museum was very disappointing for us. By comparison, GoremeOAM was 3x more expensive than Zelve, most of the sites inside Goreme OAM was closed, too many people were around, the sites that they allow taking pictures in were the boring ones. The ones with paintings were prohibited from pictures being taken. Also, there was one site where you have to pay extra to get in.Basically, we were only there for only about 30 minutes and had managed to get around and see everything, except for the prohibited areas and paid sites. Compared to Zelve that took almost 2 hours to explore, GoremeOAM was not worth it. (Plus the ticket fee was too much for a 30-minute small-round tour).The only thing GoremeOAM has that was better than Zelve was the colourful religious drawings.	2020-10	1	2	0
132	132	Day Tour	Going into this tour, I didn’t know much about the people that resided in this region. Afterwards I learn so many different facts that I never wouldn’t known or thought of. Christians monks/nuns living in the rock formations calling it their homes for centuries. A must do if you are visiting the region.	2020-11	5	2	1
133	133	Beautiful place	Great views and friendly people! Be ready for a hike! There is a small fee to enter but it is worth it	2020-11	5	2	1
134	134	Get there as soon as it opens	Please go early (8:30) if you can. Get there before the big group tours. The cave churches are confined spaces so if you don't get there early, you'll be queing being the big group tours. No pictures or guides allowed in the frescoed churches so take a picture of the sign outside so you know what each fresco is talking about. I definitely think seeing the frescos are worth it. There is another church inside that has a separate entrance fee that also has a bunch of frescos that is worth seeing.	2020-11	5	2	0
135	135	Never knew about the ancient churches	Nice big area for sightseeing.  Interesting history with all of the cave churches and frescoes.   A little annoying that they make you pay extra to go into the dark church and don't let you take photos (even without flash).	2020-10	5	2	1
136	136	Mesmerizing !	One of the first historical sites you should visit in Cappadocia, showing several of many Christian carved in churches. You may book a tour separately or directly walk/take taxi to Göreme Open Air Museum. Your tour guide may explain each location separately or you can purchase audio explanation.	2020-10	5	2	1
137	137	Amazing early church community history	Enjoyed the self-paced tour.  Incredible history of early Christian communities in this area. Make sure you include the “dark church” cave as well. The paintings are incredible and remarkably preserved.	2020-10	5	2	1
138	138	Beautiful	We walked from Goreme  and it took is around an hour to get there (we didn't rush). The ancient chruches and the paintings were beautiful. We didn't go to the Dark Church.	2020-09	4	2	0
139	139	Overrated - Lots of people - Go hike the Red/Rose Valley instead :)	You can get the same views, go inside the churches, and see the frescos within the Rose/Red Valley hikes for free, without all the people and queues, and be able to take pictures.	2020-10	3	2	0
140	140	Not worth the ticket price	So fees were 65TL.  As reference, the Topkapı Palace entry fee is 75TL, and there’s so much more to see in Topkapı than this place.  If you just go hiking in the Rose valley, you’d be able to see more impress churches for free.	2020-10	2	2	0
141	141	Oh what a world	Fascinating to see what has been, and what is lost to erosion. Sad to see life has gone, and sadder to see monuments desecrated, but despite all it’s the highlight of Cappadocia.	2020-10	5	2	0
142	142	Beautiful caves and rock formations	Surprising interesting visit. The caves chiseled into the rock faces make you wonder about the tenacity and ingenuity of the human kind. A must visit in Cappadocia.	2020-10	4	2	1
143	143	Many small rock churches	A large open air museum in which there are paved walkways between many rock churches. Some not open, some with little in them, others with very good imagery and carved rooms and sleeping quarters.  The additional 25tl for the Dark Church indicates this is the best for ceiling paintings.  Included on a Cappadocia card for three days which is well worth it if visiting without tour groups.	2020-09	5	2	1
144	144	Something quite different	Interesting cave dwellings and churches dug in the rocks. Very expensive entrance, and you have to pay extra to get into the church which has slightly preserved wall paintings. Quite a struggle to walk around on a hot day	2020-10	4	2	0
145	145	Worth a visit	Easy access with adequate parkingPlenty of good sights and caves to enterCafe for refreshments and shops for giftsGood value and opportunity to get up close to the remarkable rock features	2020-09	4	2	1
146	146	Awesome place	We had such a fun and exciting time visiting Goreme Open-Air Museum. As archaeologist myself, it was so amazing to see things that you read about!	2020-10	5	2	1
147	147	Fantastic place	This is an amazing site. The entrance fee is hefty but it kinda slips from memory as one wanders through the site. Most of it is well-preserved and has attendants making sure everything remains intact. Some areas could do with a bit more attention to maintain the site for future generations	2020-09	5	2	1
148	148	Interesting place	We hired a scooter for the day to get around Göreme and beyond for the day but it’s just about a 20 minutes walk on foot and easy to get to. There is a haunting atmospheric beauty here, which is dominated by the churches and homes that served as a refuge for early Christians escaping Roman and Persian persecution. The museum is well maintained and most parts are accessible. It is certainly worth a visit as it’s not far from the town. We hired an audio guide for 25TL but we soon realised that we didn’t really need it because there are information boards at the entrances of the caves in English and Turkish which has the same details as given by the audio guide. The dark church has a separate entrance fee. It looks beautiful from the photos display outside. We chose not to visit so we can’t comment on it. There is a good souvenir shop and refreshment place near the entrance which was a welcome respite for us, as it was a very hot on the day of our visit. Not sure if they serve good as well but they have delicious ice creams and a selection of cold drinks. Keep your entrance ticket it gives you access to another cave church a bit further down the road.	2020-09	4	2	1
149	149	Great fun experience	Went here during the Red Tour, which we had with an English speaking guide. Great experience walking around the caves and churches. The Dark church up the hill is extra to get it in to but I recommend the entrance as it was worth checking out even without the ability to take photos inside. The paintings were very well preserved and you can definitely see the set as it was supposed to be seen unlikeManu other churches were painting were crosses out or damaged.	2020-09	5	2	1
150	150	Nice Place but Not Worth the Fee	Historic place of past religious christian in the third century. They caved the rocked for worship and turn these holes to helly churches. You can find painting of churches on the walls.	2020-09	4	2	0
151	151	Such an interesting place	This place is well worth a visit and you can see numerous churches built into the hillside where the early Christian byzantine community lived under persecution. We visited early in the morning so it was not too busy. There is not much interpretation around the site and this could be improved a lot. There were guides you could take to help explain the site. It is a shame that there isn’t a small interpretive visitor centre when you arrive to give the overview of the community that lived there. The churches are really wonderful with the vibrant painted ceilings. You are not allowed to take pictures in the churches.	2020-09	3	2	1
152	152	Better with a guide!	Great place to visit but with a guide so what you’re seeing makes sense! Bring water and hat as it can get hot on the rocks.	2020-09	5	2	1
153	153	Beautiful, interesting	It's interesting to see what humans were able to do in stone. 75 tl to visit the place. 25 tl more for the dark church. You can also get an audio guide or guided tour for something like 20 tl. Absolutely amazing! 2 hours should be enough to visit it, read a bit about each church and take some pretty pictures. You're not allowed to take photos inside of the caves, fyi.	2020-09	5	2	1
154	154	Unique	Cappadocia is a fantasyland. The town of Göreme is quaint and beautiful. The caves are all open to explore. Spend at least 3 days to truly enjoy this place. Reasonable prices for attractions and food	2020-08	4	2	1
155	155	Christan Monastery	Very nice place to visit if you are Christian. You have to see nine Monastery in caves of Cappadocia.	2020-09	5	2	1
156	156	Too bad the won't allow you to take pictures	This is a sort of oper air museum of churches, this is all you can see here, and you are not allowed to take pictures of the wall paintings inside the churches. The price is extremely high compared to the offer. After you paid 75TL entry fee, you have to pay another 25TL if you want to visit the dark church, a better preserved one of the many inside of the museum. Most of the paintings of the saints have the eyes scraped/scratched from the wall. Not a nice view.	2020-08	2	2	0
157	157	Beautiful small place with unusual landscape	Very nice and cozy place, with unusual rocks and caves landscape. A lot of points of touristic interests. 2 hours is optimal time to stay to cover all in comfortable tempo.	2020-09	4	2	1
158	158	Historically fascinating	My partner and I visited the open air museum on our first day and found the local history to be amazing. We paid the standard entry fee but we thought it was enough for us to see and do. You could pay more to see more churches that were of better quality and archaeological brilliance.	2020-08	5	2	1
159	159	Unreal caves	75 lira to get in to the open museum which consists of lots carved out caves and awesome rock formations. Worth a visit if you’re in the area!	2020-08	5	2	1
160	160	Worth a visit if you like historical churches	Location opens around 10 (as far as we could find) and is open till 7 pm.  Easy parking lot with about a 75 meter walk.  Large concentration of christian churches carved into the rock formations.  Very cool to see how they did this and the beautiful art.  NOTE: many of the fresco's' faces have been distroyed, especially those of Christ.  They do not let you take pictures in the rooms with the christian depictions but is still pretty amazing to see so many churches in such a close proximity.  I went alone and took only 1 hour.  MUST go into the black church.  It is the best preserved, you can see the procession of Christ's live and get a fell for how beautiful it really was.  Its an extra 25 lira but well worth it.  The church (which is free with paid admission) to the north of the entrance is also very nice and should not be missed.  Upstairs is large with great pictures and mostly intact.  Downstairs is unique with the pillars.  Sit in the stone chair and the far end and if you can sing a low note, you will hear how well the acoustics are and how it vibrates through the whole place.  Glad I went.  Admission is 75 lira for the general part and church across streat, 25 lira for black church.  Went at 4:30 and then went just up the hill to watch sunset.  Worked out well.  Was a little hot but inside each church and room, very cool.	2020-08	4	2	0
161	161	Sooooo cool	Loved the landscape, don’t miss it. We bought the museum card and then visited a few more places on it the next 3 days. Walk at your own pace and explore. Def recommend sneakers and work out/easy type of clothing as some inclines etc	2020-08	5	2	1
162	162	Amazing historical museum	This place is wonderful. A great place to walk around. It is enough to keep children entertained going in and out of the cave rooms. Only let down is the rip off shop on site. Over priced drinks and ice creams preying on those on tours.	2020-08	5	2	1
163	163	Must see	It is a must-see place. A little difficult in hot weather, but worth it. Wear something comfortable instead of a skirt. It is more comfortable if there are shoes.	2020-08	5	2	0
164	164	Unique Landscape	The open air museum is an excellent place to visit to experience how life in the area must have been thousands of years ago. Highly recommended visit.	2020-08	5	2	1
165	165	Oh we missed out!	The museum was open, but most enclosed chapels and spaces were closed due to covid.  What a site! Having come from Tibet where there are still large operational monasteries and nunneries, I could just imagine this place also in action with monks and nuns of a different kind.  I found myself listening to Hildegard of Bingen as I wondered through and had a very special time.	2020-07	5	2	1
166	166	Amazing caves, unique experience!	An ancient civilization that lived inside the caves, we have been taken around by a Turkish tourist adviser who speak English, very friendly guy who explained to us the history of the place. It is a must visit f you are already in the region.	2019-07	5	2	0
167	167	Experiencing Winter During Spring in Cappadocia	It was snowing during our visit since there was weather anomaly in Cappadocia. The view was quite amazing as if it was from one of the locations on Game of Thrones. The stairs leading to the chapels inside the caves were pretty narrow with no handrail in several spots along the stairs. There was only one way to enter and to exit making it quite crowded at times. As it was snowing during our time there, the stairs become slippery too. You surely need to wear suitable shoes for walking as you need to go through quite a few flight of stairs to visit the ancient chapels inside the cave.Also be mindfull of the narrow stairs if you are travelling with young children and/or elderly people.Please noted that it is forbidden to take pictures inside the cave due to risk of the camera flash damaging the centuries old paintings on chapel's wall. Kindly only take pictures when you are outside of the caves.There were several cafes and souvenir shop inside the open air museum. The prices on those establishments was quite the standard of tourist attraction.	2019-05	4	2	1
168	168	Very interesting place	Better to visit during lunch time as it will be less crowded. It is a must visit place near Goreme and close by.	2020-03	5	2	1
169	169	Worth a visit	Although you would see similar formations all through Goreme town, it is worth visiting this museum. Entering some of the churches and kitchens, etc is fascinating. Reading some history before going would add value	2020-03	4	2	1
170	170	Highly recommended	Highly recommend visiting this museum. Spectacular dwellings with tombs and chapels. Highly recommend buying a ticket for the dark church. Please be aware: it is forbidden to take photos of the insides of the chapels.	2020-02	5	2	1
171	171	Overpriced Musuem with Some Interesting Cave Homes	We visited on a relatively quiet weekday. The admission price is absolutely absurd for how small the museum was. It was an interesting visit but nothing special. I would have preferred to just venture off the beaten path and explore the caves that line the area without the tourist factor and self explore. Would not really recommend unless you already have a museum pass or are really interested into more tourist hotspots rather then going on your own adventure.	2020-03	3	2	1
172	172	stunning natural rock/cave formations	"The Goreme Open-Air Museum is an amazing outdoor park to tour. The many caves are awesome to explore. The ""churches"" inside some of these caves are beautiful to see."	2019-11	5	2	1
173	173	Interesting	Interesting cave system where early Christians used to live in hiding due to the forbidden religion before the Roman empire adopted it as its own.	2020-03	5	2	0
174	174	Best place to visit	The cost to enter was about 75 Turkish lira but it was worth it. The pictures came out amazing and the museum has great history. But the views were awesome.	2020-03	5	2	1
175	175	You must not miss this !	This is absolutely beautiful and well worth the visit. It is also worth going on a guided tour or getting the audio guide for 25 TL. Also leave about 2-3 hours to visit as you will get tired because it is very steep and there are many stairs. Leave enough time to rest and see the whole place	2020-03	5	2	0
176	176	Interesting churches	Interesting churches built into the caves with original paintings. However, the audio guide wasn't working for us so we didn't know what the various holes in the wall were used for. The ground is very slippery in winter so be prepared to fall. It's a great place to learn about early Christianity.	2020-02	4	2	1
177	177	Amazing place!	This was part of a tour organised for us by our agent in Istanbul (Efendi Travel).  The local guide picked up my wife and myself from the hotel, and took us around local sights in a mini-bus (there were about ten people in the minibus, picked up from various hotels in Goreme).   Highlight of the day, undoubtedly, was the Goreme Open-Air Museum.  Truly amazing!  If you have not organised a tour which includes this museum, get it done through your hotel front desk.  I would NOT advise anyone who does not know Turkish to just wander around on your own.  It may be a bit cheaper, but you would waste a lot of time.  In any case, you would not know what you were looking at.  The local guides can explain the history and background of the various churches, monasteries and convents hewn into the rock.  This place is a delight for both history buffs and photo buffs.  We were lucky, we went on a bright sunny day.  I don't how dangerous it would be on a wet day, you would get badly hurt if you slip and fall.  Talking of slipping: wear GOOD walking shoes, real sturdy ones, which grip your heel, and which would prevent you from losing your footing.  There is a bit of climbing.  NOT a place for someone in a wheelchair.  Also, NOT a good place for someone with a stroller.  Keep a sharp eye on little kids with you: they could easily get lost in the crowds, or they could fall.  Good toilet facilities near the entrance.  The place is HUGE, it would be simply impossible to see it fully, unless you spend several hours here.  Most tour operators (like ours) allow just about two hours.  Just enough time to see the highlights.	2019-04	5	2	0
178	178	Open Air Meusum	It is an assortment of ancient churches and religious communities in a single spot. The spot is enormous and bunches of steps to climb. Do put on agreeable wear.	2020-02	5	2	1
179	179	Breath Taking	Breath Taking views.  This place takes back in time.   When people were living in simpler times.  When a small cave carved in mountains would be considered home.	2020-02	5	2	0
180	180	Remarkable views and churches	Very nice glimpse of how life was like in the caves but the ticket entrance fee is quite steep with a standalone ticket for the attractions inside	2020-02	5	2	1
181	181	Extraordinary sights	Visited this extraordinary open air museum on our visit. There were many fascinating stone developments. There were various houses of worship incorporated with the stones that were so intriguing to see. Certainly worth a visit	2020-02	5	2	1
182	182	Great experience	It is special place with a great view on a beautiful landscape. The caves are fascinating but it is sad that you need to pay extra for a black church.	2020-02	4	2	1
183	183	Beautiful	The open air museum at Göreme is interesting. The cavern chapels and living quarters are simply stunning. Unquestionably an absolute necessity in the event that you go to Turkey.	2020-02	5	2	1
184	184	Totally Magnificent	One of a must if you travel to Cappadocia. 1. Series of tower shaped buildings which was constructed during the Byzantine era. 2. Magnificent from the outside and inside. 3. Some of the drawings and paintings are damaged and not well preserved. 4. If you are aiming for well preserved drawings, go for dark museum definitely. Although you need to pay extra, I consider it as the main best highlight of the museum.	2020-01	5	2	1
185	185	The most gorgeous and intriguing collection of rock settlements and internal churches in Cappadocia	One of the few places where you can get a first hand experience of what the settlements looked like from the inside, and how they would have lived their life. Some of the chapels within with the original frescos are delightful to watch. The sheer fact that the dyes they used then are surviving since the 11th century is laudable. If the sunlights right, the play of light and shadows that’s created on the rocks is a delight to view. Truly a magnificent experience to be able to walk through time.	2020-01	5	2	1
186	186	Impressive sight, take care in the snow	We decided to stop in here on the way back from Avanos to Goreme. Desipite heavy snowfall overnight, we enjioyed exploring this place. The outdoor caves and rock formations were an impressive sight. Take care in snowy/icy conditions, as the pathways were very slippery in some sections. Good shoes/hiking boots are recommended. Entry is included on the museum pass. Buses are available from Avanos and Goreme for 5TL, expect to pay 30TL for a taxi to/from Goreme.	2020-02	5	2	1
187	187	Must Visit	We went to Goreme open air museum as a part of the Private Highlights of Cappadocia where we could see the beautiful picturesque views of the valley and the churches formed inside the caves.	2020-01	4	2	1
188	188	Crammed Full of Tourists	I love the history of the place and highly recommend taking a walk to the museum instead of public transport. The only problem with most sites in Turkey is that it's crammed full of tourists. It's very hard to imagine the tranquility that those who carved out these caves must've experienced when everyone is trying to get their instagram shots, boomerangs and videos for their amateur youtube vlogs.You need to be strategic about how you walk through this museum. Everyone is taking photos and videos and everyone wants to be everywhere. My advice is to take it slow. Rest often and just take it all in.1 thing that you'll also find is that the better preserved sites are an additional fee. Save your money and go to the museum lower down the road with the same ticket instead. It's way better preserved that anything in the open air museum but, once again, also very full.	2019-08	3	2	1
189	189	must do!	The entire Goreme area is spectacular.  I would never seen anything like this in my home country.  highly recommend	2020-01	5	2	1
190	190	Historic wonder	Very interesting visit, amazing to see structures so old surviving to tell a story. The open air museum is a concentration of churches that is certainly worth going in Goreme.	2020-01	4	2	1
191	191	Remarkable, preserved history of early persecuted Christians	This is one of the places well worth spending a few hours at after one has seen the Fairy Chimneys and Love Valley etc.  The amazingly preserved wall pictures and rooms carved into the living rock are impressive.  One marvels at the work it must have taken to dig all the tunnels and passages as well as create the art.Steep walking required. So, mobility impaired beware.	2019-07	5	2	1
192	192	Complex of 11th-13th century churches carved into the rock	"Museu a Ceu Aberto de Goreme (Göreme Open Ar Museum) is 1.5km southeast of the village center.  This large site contains dozens of rock-cut religious buildings: churches (dating to the 11th-13th centuries), chapels, monasteries, nunneries, and other buildings, it was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage in 1984.  The churches contain beautiful frescoes (wall paintings) whose colors are still visible.  There are eleven refectories (dining halls, each associated with a church) with tables and benches carved from the rock.  There are many churches and chapels in the museum but the most important ones are: -- Nunnery: A 6-7 story rock outcrop with a carved-out dining hall, kitchen and other rooms on the first floor, a ruined chapel on the second level, and the church on the third.-- St. Barbara Church (second half of the 11th century):  Cruciform plan, with two columns, barrel vaults and domes, red frescoes portray geometrical patterns, mythological animals and military symbols. -- Apple (Elmali) Church (11th and 12th centuries): Groin-vaulted with cross-in-square plan, having four columns and a central dome.  Colored frescoes depict scenes from the Bible and the life of Christ, the Hospitality of Abraham and Three Hebrew Youths.  Named for an apple orchard which used to be in front of the church.-- Snake (Yilanli) Church (11th century) : Two chambers, linear plan with a barrel vault.  Frescoes depict Christ holding a bible, Emperor Constantine and Helena, St. George killing a snake, St. Theodore,  Onophrios,  Apostle Thomas, and Church-founder St. Basileios holding a book in one hand and sanctifying with the other.-- Dark Church (Karanlik Kilise, 12th century, extra fee of 8TL to visit): Barrel-vaulted narthex, cross plan, three graves. Frescoes depict Deesis, Annunciation, Journey to Bethlehem, Nativity, Baptism, Raising of Lazarus, Transfiguration, Entry into Jerusalem, Last Supper, Betrayal of Judas, the Crucifixion and Anastasis.-- Carikli (Sandals) Church (end of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th centuries): Two columned church, cross vaulted, three apses and four domes. Christ  Pantocrator on the center dome.  Frescoes depict the life of Jesus, Hospitality of Abraham, and images of the saints and the donors of the church.  The footprints under the Ascension scene give the church its name, which means ""with sandal"".  -- Buckle (Tokali) Church (50m from main site, but ticket is good): Four chambers, rectangular plan.  New and old church, decorations from various periods: Infancy (childhood of Christ), Ministry and Passion cycles, and several episodes from the life of St. Basileios.Photography is not permitted within the churches, and light is dim.  There is usually a single entrance to each small church, so there can be a wait until the previous group of visitors empties out.  In summer, the site can be crowed (dozens of tour buses)  and hot, so an early-morning or late-afternoon visit is recommended, along with sturdy footwear, a hat and water.  The museum is open from 8am-7.15pm daily with an entry fee of ₺54"	2019-05	5	2	0
193	193	Very unique historical artistic experience	The open air museum is strongly recommended in the area- it’s combined architecture, arts and nature and history . The ancient painting inside gives a very quiet and simple sense of beauty. Recommend - spend 2 hours to clearly go with the audio guide and more reference material and go through all the caves to enjoy the time machine :)	2019-12	5	2	1
194	194	It is amazing	I went with My husband today. I was a bit cold but totally worth it. We visited with no guide, just read the signs. We recommend you pay the extra 18 liras and enter the dark church the paintings are just amazing and well preserved. The general view is surreal.	2020-01	5	2	1
195	195	Must do in Cappadocia	The Goreme Open Air Museum is a must do in Cappadocia! Do not miss it because it has beautiful panoramas of the fairy chimneys, and gives a glimpse into the lives of the monks there. It requires atleast two hours of walking so be prepared for this. We did this by ourselves and not as part of any tour, but we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. Definitely recommend it!	2019-09	5	2	1
196	196	Amazing place	The history is so fantastic and it is worth to know. You can spend around 2 hours to know the caves, church and wonderful meeting sight.	2019-11	5	2	1
197	197	Amazing place with churches inside caves	This place is one of the main attractions of Gerome. There are a number of churches inside caves. The caves contain large number ancient paintings. It is believed that monks and nuns used to practise Christianity here hidden from the ouside world	2019-09	4	2	1
198	198	Amazing place	You can easily spend up to two hours here. Everything is so amazing and pretty with so much history. Audio guide is TRY25. You also need to pay extra if you want to go to the dark church (only if you are very interested in the paining on the wall)	2019-11	5	2	0
199	199	I was expecting more	It was just Ok. Many people told us it was an amazing impressive museum, not to be missed. It was a repetition of old caverns paintings with not so much meaning, except for one or two.At least that was my experience doing it on my own, maybe an organized tour would look different.	2019-06	3	2	0
200	200	Don’t miss it	I am a traveler who never thought of going to capadoccia, it just happened and I’m so happy about it. What an amazing place to see a great place full of history. I really had an amazing tune in there	2019-10	5	2	1
201	201	Interesting but expensive for what you get	The Goreme Open Air Museum is a testament to the spirit and dedication of a culture committed to literally carving a place to live and practice its religious beliefs out of the rocks & hills.  Centuries of incredibly hard work are on display dating as far back as the 10th century.  Unfortunately, a ticket to get in costs about US$10 (52 TL) and what is left to see and what you have access to is limited.  The site is 1.5 km from Goreme center and can be easily walked.	2019-10	3	2	0
202	202	Amazing to see	Spent a few hours at Goreme Open Air Museum and it was amazing! It was quite full when we were there and we had to queue to see inside some of the churches but it is unbelievable. Worth a trip!	2019-09	4	2	1
203	203	What an incredible exhibition	The open air museum at Göreme is unique.  The cave churches and living quarters are just amazing. Definitely a must if you go to Turkey.	2019-10	5	2	1
204	204	If you haven’t done Petra, it is a nice visit	We were lucky to go when it was pretty much empty so we got to enjoy the museum without any crowd and noise. We didn’t have a guide so the visit was rather us walking around and reading the available information along the way. You can do the overall in about 1h. I did find that the routes were not well indicated so sometimes you ended up taking a path with a dead end. I think if you have never seen something like it, it is a nice experience. If you have however been to Petra, it is quite disappointing.	2019-10	4	2	1
205	205	Out of this world!	I was surprised to see something like this. Its like you are brought to another world. These rock cave formations are also full of history. One must visit at and be put into your bucket list.	2019-09	5	2	1
206	206	Well worth a visit	I visited Goreme Open Air Museum having had it recommended  to me by my hotel host.The main entrance was fairly busy when I arrived at just after 10am, however buying a ticket was quick and easy. The ticket price was 54 Turkish Lira. My hotel host had suggested that I also take the voice/headphones tour as part of my visit, as I was on my own and without a guide.The headphone tour was 24 Turkish Lira which was great value, the only problem being that the museum requires your passport / driving licence or similar to leave with them, to ensure the return of the headphones and device (which looked pretty new). Sadly, ill-prepared  I didn’t have anything suitable with me to leave and so I missed out on the headphone tour.To be honest, if you are without a guide and without the headphone tour, it is difficult to truly understand just exactly what you’re seeing. There are the odd signs in both English and Turkish that tell you about a particular church or chapel, but looking at all the headphone signs and numbers in each of the chapels/buildings, I couldn’t help thinking this place held some amazing tales for the visitor to hear.There is quite a lot of uphill walking and some of the chapels are accessed via steep staircases that serve both the visitor entering and exiting. Some of the stairs get a little busy but for me it wasn’t really a problem.The further uphill you climb, the more you are rewarded with spectacular views towards Goreme. There are plenty of photo opportunities and at the top of the hill is a nice Turkish themed coffee shop selling cold drinks, books and Turkish Coffee (cooked in sand).Also at the top of the hill is access to Karanlik Kilise or The Dark Church. Entry is a further 18 Turkish Lira but for me it was definitely the best church to visit and represented the real talent of the fresco artists. The reason the fresco’s are so well preserved in this church is due to it receiving such little natural light, it is well lit with artificial light for the visitor. The colours are lovely and particularly given their age, the frescos are so well drawn.At the entrance to the museum is a large museum shop where you can buy drinks and also an array of different souvenirs.Once you exit the museum and begin to walk down the hill towards Goreme, there is one more church ‘Buckle Church’ situated on the right-hand side. Entry is free if you show your Open Air Museum ticket. This church is believed to be the oldest and dates from the late 9th Century.All in all a very cultural experience that I’m glad I can say I did.	2019-10	5	2	1
207	207	Museu a Ceu Aberto de Goreme It is truly an open museum	Entry price: 70 TLOpen all days of the week: 08:00 - 18:15It is truly an open museumA museum open to natureOutdoors museum Grottoes, houses of worship, natural views, engraved rooms in the mountains..A strange museum and very wideSome places prohibit taking picturesClose to balloons activityThey offer a lot of services near itCafeResturantShops selling artifacts and antiquitiesIt can be reached by bus, car or taxi	2019-09	3	2	1
208	208	Truly worth the visit	Once again an amazing area to visit. The open air museum is just that. Amazing and with a great guide you also learn much more. Do not miss this visit.	2019-09	5	2	1
209	209	First site to visit in Goreme	We recommend to visit Open Air Museum in the morning to avoid the crowd after noon. The whole museum take around 2hours to see and enjoy. I highly recommend to use tour guide to learn rich history of this museum with early cave churches around the museum. Some churches still have good condition frescoes and paintings and some is already gone. However, all the churches are Eastern Christian Churches.  Not only the churches but also there is residences for early settlers in Cappadocia region. An interesting and top list attractions in Cappadocia.	2019-06	5	2	1
210	210	Excellent but crowded	The Open Air Museum is certainly worth a visit and a good indication of how the people lived so long ago.  The beautiful frescoes in some of the caves are magnificent considering they are from 10th to 12th century.  Try to go as early in the morning as possible as it gets very crowded.	2019-08	5	2	1
211	211	Nice visit	We spent almost 2 hours walking around which was enough for an almost complete visit of the place. Renting the audio guide was worth it.	2019-09	5	2	1
212	212	Very air opened museum but dirty	Nice open air museum with a lot of of caves and rooms but is dirty. People throwing plastic, paper, cigarettes around your eyes watch.Is so sad how the visitors are careless.Try to visit is a different museum. If you don't like to walk or history better avoid.	2019-06	3	2	1
213	213	Interesting caves	The museum is home to some interesting caves carved out in the local rock formations. They include churches, dining rooms, kitchens etc. The churches have interesting paintings, but many were damaged on purpose by local people and were not restored. The museum is not so big and after a while the sights are repeated.	2019-08	4	2	0
214	214	Nice place	Worth it visiting if you stay in capadoccia for some days. Take a hat and some water with you to enjoy the walk	2019-08	4	2	1
215	215	Amazing Frescos and Churches	Due to the dry climate, frescos painted on the church walls that date from the tenth to the thirteenth centuries are still very vibrant. Our tour guide explained what we would see in each church before we entered. It was a very busy site, so it is best to arrive as early as possible. Some of the paths and steps into the buildings are loose (crumbly and uneven) so I recommend wearing shoes with good traction. It is also worth the extra admission to visit the Dark Church.	2019-06	5	2	1
216	216	Breathtaking experiences	It was a very special experience. Never been here before. I enjoyed every minute of it. Most of the thing spoke for itself. There could be a little more written information besides the given information they display on boards next to each stop at the museum. Summarising this museum would be easy. It is a lot of churches from the 9th-12th century. I between the churches there are a few cave-like places in which people used to eat sleep or storage their food during those centuries. I did not end the full tour, but as far as I have seen, this would be a good summary for the museum. I would definitely come here again and recommend this to others. Be aware that taking photos or videos inside is not allowed.	2019-08	4	2	1
217	217	Great sights	Visited this great open air museum on our tour. There were many interesting rock formations. There were a number of churches built into the rocks that were so interesting to see. Definitely worth a visit!	2019-07	5	2	1
218	218	Very good but expect some crowds depending on the season	"About a 15-20 minute walk from most of the hotels. On 2 August 2019 I paid the following. 54 TL for entrance fee, 25 TL for an audio guide and an additional 18 TL to see the Dark Church. Only the entrance fee is mandatory but I highly recommend the Dark Church (best Frescos) and mildly recommend the audio guide (some signs in the park, but not the best I've seen in Turkey. A word of caution with the audio guide as you have to leave some form of ID card/passport as a ""deposit"". Everything is just put into a cardboard box and they don't verify what you take out. So in other words you could leave your passport and someone else could take it before you return. Recommendation: use your least valuable form of ID card. Finally, it should be expected in the peak tourist season, it will be pretty crowded. Only an issue going in and out of those little Chambers. All the best ones will have guards, to prevent photography especially in the Dark Church. They want you to buy the guide books in the museum store of course! It's one of the biggest ones I have seen during my travels in Turkey by the way. Overall, recommended."	2019-08	4	2	1
219	219	A huge collection of Churches	The open air museum is an expansive collection of churches. You will need comfortable footwear, sun protection, water and a good knowledge (guide) of the place - to be able to enjoy it. If you don't know the history behind each church, you may not be able to appreciate the place. Pictures are prohibited at many places. The frescos, though disfigured mostly, are beautiful and inspiring. You have to buy a separate ticket for the dark church, which is a little away from the main area - but its a good place to visit. Some exhibits are closed for restoration right now.	2019-06	4	2	1
220	220	Open air museum	It is incredible area to visit. The old house in the cave, very life conditions of centuries ago. We saw christian bizantianian style church inside the cave, big impact. We saw all the area with baloon early in the morning. Realle fantastic experience	2019-06	5	2	1
221	221	Must see in Goreme	This museum is located 25-30 minutes on foot from Goreme center. There you can find many small churches scattered around on the hill. Entrance fee to the museum is 45TL. There is an extra 15TL fee for entrance to the Dark Church. Audio guide costs 25TL but I don't recommend it because it was heavy to carry on a hot day plus that the guide was not very helpful.	2019-07	4	2	1
222	222	Rich History, Few Pictures Allowed	This is a must while staying in Goreme as it gives you a better idea of the early history of the area as well as some good church history. It was fairly crowded walking into the narrow spaces with large tour groups as these are small spaces not built for many people. Keep in mind that photos are not allowed in many of the chapels and that sometimes there are employees stationed around to keep a watchful eye. The Dark Church (Karanlik Kilise) is the big ticket item for many tourists, but it's an additional 15 TL (this was recently raised and is just shy of $3 in June 2019) to enter. According to the site this is to alleviate traffic for conservation. Also slightly disappointing were the two or three closed exhibits for restoration and/or safety. It's hot, so bring water.	2019-06	4	2	1
223	223	In awe!	Such natural and wondrous beauty! The cave dwellings and churches are otherworldly. Still preserved so well to this day.	2019-06	5	2	1
224	224	The best experience	You must visit the tour in cappadocia, there are a lot of options to get one, I got one of the best. Just don’t forget to put sonscreen	2019-06	5	2	1
225	225	Awesome Frescos!	The Göreme Open Air Museum is a short walk from the city center.  It’s also part of the the Green tour if you’d rather have a guide.  This attraction is home to about 12 monasteries and 1 nun covenant.  Only some portions are open to the public.  It is very cool since it was in use up until 1924 by Eastern Orthodox Christians.  As such, the fresco paintings are still colorful and simply amazing to look at.  It’s also interesting to see older wall paintings without pictures from earlier times when the church didn’t allow any type of image of Jesus or the apostles. There were guards and a strict no picture taking policy in all the church buildings. Besides the churches, you can see stables, kitchens and dining rooms that may have also served as class rooms.	2019-06	4	2	1
226	226	The best fresco's are found in the Dark church	This museum is a good example of an old monastry complex with several functions including housing, churches and production sites as well as safe storage from mouraiding tribal groups. For the Dark church you need to pay an additional 15 TL, but it is beautiful and well illuminated.Down the road outside the museum you can visist a partly restored chuch. However you may not take any pictures, otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars.	2019-06	4	2	1
227	227	Rather complete monastry complex with the best preserved and undamaged fresco's	The Open Air museum has several churches and rooms  along a well paved track of not more than 1 km, considering the stairs and all.  The nicest collection of fresco's is in a church for which an additional TL 15/pp must be paid, but very much worth while. It is not allowed to take photos in most locations. Ilumination inside the caves is good.  With the ticket another church down the road is also accessible. Here a group of Italian restoration specialists worked with turkish to restore a good part of the fresco's. The blue colour is predominantly here.	2019-06	5	2	1
228	228	Nice	It’s a very nice place, a must go when visiting Capadoccia. You walk though what was a Village locates arpund a valley, with many carved houses with its different rooms (stable, kithchen, bedroom...). You can also get inside an ancient church that still has a few signs of paintings on the walls and also a small mosk. I recommend to spend at least 30-40 min to do the full walk around The Valley.	2019-06	5	2	0
229	229	Back to the Byzantine Era	Nice myseum with a lot of information and stories of the Cappadocia region. The fresco paintings on the walls is worth seeing	2019-06	5	2	1
230	230	Best in Cappadocia	Great place takes you back in BC time. Worth a visit. Amazing place rich in history. Wonderful place.	2019-05	5	2	1
231	231	Amazing!!	Great place to visit, lots of history, also lots of walking up and down stairs so wear confy shoes, tennis shoes if possible! But definitely worth visiting!	2019-05	5	2	1
232	232	Open air museum	It is a collection of ancient churches and monasteries in one place. The place is huge and lots of steps to climb. Do put on comfortable wear.	2019-05	4	2	1
233	233	Origin of Christianity in Turkey	We were on a 7 day coach tour of Turkey, with Intra Tours, and this was on our itinerary and our guide told us it was where Christianity in Turkey began, when it was against the law to be a Christian.There were several churches open to view, but in reality they were all small caves although some had nice frescoes in reasonable condition considering how old they were. The entrance fee was 45 TL (£6)	2019-05	3	2	1
234	234	Superrr	İf you came goreme definetly you should go this place. Landcape,caves,churches very interesting.....	2019-05	5	2	0
235	235	Day 1 green tour	Wonderful heritage site. Medium to high level fitness to reach some places. Extra charge for cathedral views (annoying to pay again inside). Lovely gift shop. Could spend half a day wondering in & out of caves.	2019-05	5	2	1
236	236	Also known as the open air museum	We were advised to miss this as it would be crowded. Instead we went straight there after breakfast and therefore managed to missed all the guided tours which seem to start at 9:30. The museum opens at 8am so there is plenty of time to see it without the crowds.Personally I was pretty underwhelmed.  Very few of the churches had good frescoes  and other than alot of crypts there wasn't much to see. Personally I would give it a miss, not because of the crowds, but just because it is not worth the entry fee.	2019-05	2	2	0
237	237	Be aware: the main attraction is closed!	"Karanlık Kilise (Dark Church) - the main attraction in the Göreme Open Air Museum is closed for the restoration (a guard said ""for 6 months""). There is no information about this on website or on entry to the site. Even more - if you buy Museum Pass for Cappadocia you will get the info that the Dark Church is included! I understand that they have to secure this monument but they can inform about it and shouldn't sell the tickets."	2019-04	1	2	1
238	238	Try to Avoid the Crowds	We were on the Red Tour for 28 euros per person.  This was our 2nd stop.  Entrance for 45 tl was included in our tour price.  When we came late morning, it was already super crowded with tour groups.In some places, there was a line to get in and photography is not allowed in all rooms.  Probably to keep people moving.  The area is impressive but just too many people which takes away from the experience.  Thus the 4 out of 5 stars.	2019-04	4	2	0
239	239	time traveling	we visited this site on a day tour. it's truly amazing and exquisite. a real travel back in time, a fantastic experience.	2019-04	5	2	1
240	240	Very expensive, crowded and not so special	Maybe this place is a good deal to people without a car because there are a lot of places like this and better near Goreme by car.I visited a lot of places in Capadoccia and everything was very nice and I didn’t see so many tourists like in this place (at least at that time, maybe in the end of spring and summer everything is crowded in Capadoccia and all Turkiye).Many teenagers groups screaming inside the caves...bad experience for a couple. The only good thing in this place is the church in the other side of the street wich goes unnoticed by most tourists.So, if you have a car I do not recommend this place.	2019-03	2	2	1
241	241	Very interesting	Very interesting to explore. We went on the Red Tour,  and I think we are not there long enough to see it all...it was a bit rushed. I advise you to go by yourself if you really want to see it all and take your time.	2019-04	5	2	0
242	242	The Reason to Visit Göreme	This is definitely the best Göreme has to offer. Do not shy away from paying 70 TL (10 euro) for the entrance ticket. You’ll see the best preserved chapels and rocks here.	2019-04	5	2	1
243	243	Nice churches	Unfortunately, on the nicest ones, you are not allowed to take pictures. The frescoes are really beautiful, and some, quite nicely preserved. Go early to avoid crowds.	2019-04	4	2	0
244	244	Must Visit! Highlight of our trip	This place was so unexpectedly spectacular and I'm so glad we visited this outdoor museum.  It was so interesting to see how Christians used to live in the caves. Some of the frescoes are very well preserved on the walls.	2019-04	5	2	1
245	245	Not to be misses!	Something to be seen. It’s so unique and rich because of its history that it can’t be missed. So many aspects: religious, way of living, challenges...	2019-04	5	2	0
246	246	Amazing outdoor museum	We were amazed by the structures and the beautiful paintings inside the churches.  It was incredibly wandering around and imagining what life was like in the early days of Christianity.	2019-03	5	2	1
247	247	Surreal and unique scenery, fascinating to explore, having a guide was useful	I visited the Göreme Open Air Museum as part of a large group of friends as we toured Turkey from Antalya to Istanbul. The Göreme valley can be seen from a few vantage points in the area (with no charge) but it was worth the small admission charge to visit this open air museum, a UNESCO heritage site. Our guide explained that this region was the birthplace of modern Christianity from around 300-400 AD and that the word Cathedral originated here, being the desk from where they preached. There are various caves (some of them were recognised as churches) to explore and many of them had original frescos on the walls and ceilings. The better frescos were in caves where no photography was permitted, and the finest of all are in one cave where there is a small extra charge, although it was worth it to see the fine original paintings. It was well worth a visit here...we had 90 minutes at the open air museum which was just about enough time to explore all the caves and check out the gift shop before heading back to the bus in the parking area, which was down the hill about 10 minutes walk away.Finally, whilst visiting the area don't miss out on trying some freshly squeezed pomegranate juice...it's super.	2018-09	5	2	1
248	248	Stunnning place	I was really amazed, I've never seen such place in my life before. To imagine, that ppl managed to live here, and walking in their footsteps, just simply has an atmosphere. even though it was a rainy day, it was a good time with my friends.	2018-04	5	2	0
249	249	History and Art	Fantastic place to visit! Great exercise to walk up and down to see the sights. Some of the religious frescos were very well-preserved.	2019-03	5	2	1
250	250	Sacred and beyond beautiful	Wow. What a brilliant place. We were lucky enough to have a guide, a local from the area. He use to play in the area as a kid. The area was devalued a heritage site in 1986 only. When you look at the stunning rich history and what has happened on this site, it is amazing to think that it was open for vandalism till recently. The churches and monasteries are so rich in history. This is a must see! Will definitely come back.	2019-03	4	2	1
251	251	Breathtaking and Stunning	You will not be disappointed by stopping here and taking in the views. It will give you a great overview on how folks managed back in the good old days...!	2019-03	5	2	1
252	252	Interesting to see	Some interesting history here, best seen with a guide to explain the monasteries and more. Very picturesque. Lots to photograph.	2019-03	4	2	1
253	253	Must visit!	Very cool place. We went for this place as part of red tour. It was raining snow that day. The guide was very informative about all the history and the conditions on every room/cave. Some stairs was a bit slippery during snow.	2019-03	5	2	1
254	254	Average place ..has a couple of old churches and nothing else...	Average place ..has a couple of old churches and nothing else...And that’s it...some cave sort formations that one can find easily all around capadoccia (so, nothing special for paying an additional ticket) n a couple of old churches...	2019-02	3	2	0
255	255	Must be	In the olden time when Roman Empire forced believers to be Pagan and forbidden Christinity,All believers were living here in Monastry life with churches with frescoes, male&female priests, cave kitchens, graves,.Dark Church has the best firescos because no light, no windows but Buckle Church with 41frescoes is a good summary of Bible	2019-02	5	2	0
256	256	Unreal Landscape	Goreme Museum is an open air museum where you get an insight into how people lived in the volcanic landscape and those weird structures where man took refuge all thsoe years ago. It is a must visit if you are in Cappadocia.	2018-08	4	2	1
257	257	Goreme	It is wonderfull! The landscape is almost unreal, with that volcanic rocks sculpted by weather and carved by men in order to be a refuge in difficult times.Can be seen a lot of churches carved in rocks, well and in the same time miraculously preserved.	2018-12	5	2	1
258	258	Fascinating Area	It costs 45TL to get into the open Air museum. It’s worth the price as the money goes to preserving that beautiful area. However, I was a bit shocked to find out you had to pay an extra 15TL per person to enter one of the churches in this area. We did not pay the extra money to go in. Read up on some of the history of this location before you go and I think your experience will be better. We went to the gift shop after words and got some Salep and a small treat. They charged us 50TL for not a whole lot, see pics for what cost us 50TL. I would not recommend getting anything at the shop. Cheaper in stores in the city	2019-01	4	2	1
259	259	Great experience	It is very authentic and interesting to view secret hidden churches and living areas. If you have a ride you can do the red tour on your own. If you are going to visit other museums too, you should buy a museum card or a 72 hour museum pass, so the price will be much lower. Also in winter time there are less people but a downside to it you cannot go some places because of the snow and the icing.	2019-01	5	2	1
260	260	Must visit	The pointy mountain are so awesome... Just magical as it it's placed... It's a must visit place.. They have red tour n green tour.. This is part of red.. With us aprox 32$pp with lunch open air museum and pottery work shop	2018-12	5	2	1
261	261	Amazing attraction but lacks readiness for snow	This attraction is must to do when in Cappadocia with amazing caves, churches. It is a ticketed attraction with car free parking on opposite side of road.Only downside we found was during snow it was very dangerously slippery. No preparations for pavements or salt spraying. We observed many tourists were falling dangerously due to snow. No handrails just ropes tied for support which were poor support.Note: please make sure to wear shoes with good grips irrespective of weather.	2018-12	4	2	0
262	262	review	on your city tour you will have the chance to visit the Goreme Open Air museum. Its possibly the only museum which is in the open and not housed in a building.  The museum houses the rich history of the region and show cases lot of old relics still preserved very nicely. to actually see the caves which were inhabited by humans just some ages ago is still unbelievable.  A must visit while in Cappadocia	2018-12	5	2	0
263	263	Magnificent	WOW... what an amazing place:)) I absolutely fell in love. And astonished to learn the fact how people lived in these caves. It’s a bucket list thing that you must do before die.  Better go early in the morning before the crowds and enjoy the caves. Try to get a guide to understand the place better.	2019-01	5	2	1
264	264	Totally worth it	The frescos in the walls are unique. The museum is something special. Totally worth it. The  entrance to the dark church is not included in the prices but is cheap (15 liras) I recommend to do it.l, it has the best paintings.	2019-01	5	2	1
265	265	Very impressive.	Great museum, amazing to see how early christians caved churches in the most crazy places. But when we were there, we couldn't pay our tickets with cards. And it is extra 15 TL to see the most impressive church. That should maybe be included in the price? But don't miss this museum! It is awsome.	2018-12	5	2	0
266	266	Unmissable.	Going to Cappadocia and not visiting these caves is like not visiting Capadoccia. Pure history of Christianity. A city made of caves, including classrooms and temples.	2018-06	5	2	1
267	267	Beautiful view	Really interesting place, as one of the first Christian city, you are able to visit inside the caves and see the old prints handmade. No picture are allowed inside	2018-12	5	2	1
268	268	Open air museum cappadocia	Beautiful experience, something diffrent from everything i have seen until now!! Highly recomend for travellers...	2018-12	5	2	1
269	269	Historic Göreme Open Museum	Travelled thru time back to 5th centuries and experience human determination and wisdom in creating such a marvel without any modern machinery.The houses and numerous churches in the cave city have living, cooking, dining, worshipping, etc, etc built in.	2018-12	5	2	0
270	270	1.5 KM walk to open Air Museum Goreme	This museum is included in the red tour but we didn't take the tour and decided to walk from Gereme town. It was 20 mins/1.5 KM walk and easily done. The entrance fees to this museum is 45 Lira per pax. We arrived at around 11 am and it was bustling with group tourists. After sometimes, it becomes annoying and specific ethnic tourists have no respect for the artifacts or other visitors. Even though they have signs stating to keep silent, clearly, most of these groups cannot keep it shut. There is an extra 15 Lira to enter the dark church but I didn't go it. There is an in-cave cafe in the center of the museum with carpeted sitting area. I would suggest you not to get juices or ice cream at an exorbitant price in the museum as there is a small stall right outside the museum selling soft Turkish ice cream at only 5 Lira & pomegranate juice at 10 Lira. Otherwise, this place is a must go while you are in Gerome area.	2018-11	5	2	0
271	271	A must go	It was about 15min walking distance from the Goreme town center.I bought the ticket and got in, there are a lot of traveling groups even though it is Nov.	2018-11	5	2	0
272	272	Crowded	The valley that was crowded the most, while the paintings are cool, I am more of a nature type and found some other locations more interesting, even the other open museum was better in my opinion.	2018-11	4	2	1
273	273	Historical place	İt was historical and naturel place ı reccomend everyone who stay in GoremeYou can walk by yourself	2018-11	5	2	1
274	274	Beautiful Place	This is not a hotel but the open air museum. It is very cool to walk around here. Goreme itself is beautiful and is where the hot balloons take off from. You can wake up around 5:00 or 6:00am and watch them from your outdoor rooftop if you have one. Which I would totally recommend, getting a hotel with a high roof and watching from there. It also has good nightlife so it is fun at night.	2018-10	5	2	1
275	275	A peaceful place and less crowded	This is in Zelve and is very peaceful than Göreme National Park. We liked it more coz you can take pictures peacefully and enjoy the caves better . All look the same almost but this place is less visited by tourists as compared to others and is less noisy.	2018-10	5	2	1
276	276	See one see them all	Here’s the summary. It’s a long line to get the tickets.Once in, see the first cave. Once you’ve seen it, you’ve seen it all. All the caves are (excepting different paintings on the walls) the same. There no information and you’re left wondering why the monks needed a jail nearby one of the rooms...Wonderful views. Once we were done, we realized that’s what most of the area has to offer: caves and rock formations. Not belittling the history or human endurance but... Seen one. Seen them all.	2018-10	3	2	1
277	277	Interesting	This is a fairly short tour of only about 15minutes so easily fits in anywhere. We did this as part of a day tour, entry cost is 45TL.Interesting to hear the history of the underground caves and how they were discovered.	2018-10	4	2	0
278	278	Insane	This place totally blew me away with it’s beauty. I’ve heard some conflicting reviews and some people saying it’s too crowded, but I didn’t feel that way at all. For me it was worth every penny and even though it’s a really small place, I wish I could have spent the whole day there, that’s how beautiful it is	2018-10	5	2	0
279	279	Amazing place to visit!	Amazing to see all the incredible landscapes here and the churches and frescoes, some still beautiful and colourful after so long.  The highlight was the Dark Church....definitely worth the extra liras and the climb up and back....you won't be disappointed.	2018-09	5	2	1
280	280	Open air museum-a must to do in Cappadocia	Worth while and very good experience being able to see close up-old churches carved out in the rocks and some of the cave homes-some steep steps but worth the effort	2018-10	4	2	1
281	281	A quick tour	After visiting a few churches, pretty much the same elsewhere. A good place foress than an hour visit.	2018-10	3	2	1
282	282	Teeming with visitors	This place is rightfully popular due to the abundance of gorgeous little cave churches. Photos are not allowed but don’t let that distract you....and pay the extra to see the phenomenal Dark Church, as the frescoes are amazingly vivid	2018-09	4	2	1
283	283	Great value - amazing sights - just time your visit	The open air museum is great - cheap to visit and gives you access to the church down the road and the key open air museum. It can get busy, but if you time it well (not mid to late morning or just after lunch) then you can have really easy access and really enjoy the site and access all the caves and churches. A must do if in Göreme.	2018-09	5	2	1
284	284	Nice place for archeology lovers	We have been today, me and my friend from Australia to the museum in the late afternoon and it was quite a nice experience since I am interesting in churches and Coptic archeology and history.Please beware that the prices and timings have been changed since October 1st, Which we didn't know about, 45 Lira for Main Entry and 15 for the Dark church.Taking photos wouldn't be an option where there are frescos and nice icons well preserved which is rare but they are kinda strict though unless if... you know.Obviously, the most preserved frescos and scenes would be in the Dark church, where it would be much more strict to take photos, at least you can enjoy the ceiling, carvins and paintings which represents one of the most important events for Christians such as Jesus baptism, crucification, holy family journey, angels and apostles and some other saints along with the famous Pantocrator (the almighty) main chapel or ceilings main subject.Sunset viewpoint is not far if you can combine it on the way back.Hope it helps... Enjoy!	2018-10	4	2	1
285	285	Nice place	It’s a nice place to visit a lot of rooms to explore It’s old images are really good to explore Take some photos from high	2018-09	3	2	1
286	286	Interesting Museum	open air museum of Goreme is a place full of story so go there with a tour guide or rent audio guide. it is better to wear athletic shoes and use sunscreen! cause as it is named an open air museum, sun can burn your skin!	2018-08	4	2	1
287	287	somewhat overrated and suffers from touristic overload.	"this could have been a great site if it wasn't run over by thousands of tourists who have absolutely no interest in it. also, many of the frescos in the churches are ruined or very faded.the one worthwhile point is the ""dark church"" or Karnalik kilise. you are charged an extra 10 tl but that acts as a great deterrent to the masses and the frescoes are amazing.basic ticket costs 30 tl and if you are really interested in the subject i'd recommend taking a guide"	2018-05	3	2	1
288	288	A fascinating glimpse of monastic life in the early days of Christianity	The Goreme Open Air Museum gave a fascinating glimpse into monastic life in the early days of Christianity in the region.  The Dark Church was stunning with its still vivid frescoes and icons.  One thing to note is that much of the museum is accessed via many steps up to the cave churches and rooms.	2018-09	5	2	1
289	289	A must in goreme !	The entrance fee is 30 TL, you will be able to enter some of the structures and see some frescoes that are pretty amazing. This a good place to take pictures too!	2018-09	5	2	1
290	290	Historical place with old churches and a nice view	This place is historical mainly if you are interested in seeing old churches and the drawings that nearly disappeared, otherwise not very interesting for younger children, needs physical power to climb up the caves.	2018-09	4	2	1
291	291	Super place	Incredible amazing ........bring water with you , september is hot ....be prepare get confortable cloth like short and at night brings a sweater 'cause down at  54oF (12oC)	2018-09	5	2	1
292	292	must see place...	its a walking distance from the town center of goreme  approximately  1 km.  one of the main attraction in goreme,  cave dwellings and early christian churches on the caves curved from the rock.	2018-08	5	2	0
293	293	AMAZING	I have no words to describe how beautifull are the Churches in this museum. Just 5 minutes from the city you'll find an UNESCO heritage.	2018-08	5	2	0
294	294	Amazing	It is one of the best places i have been to . I enjoyed every moment . View was amazing everything was great	2018-08	5	2	1
295	295	Holiday was perfect 😁	This place is amazingly beautiful. Old cave buildings inside of the stones. Fully history place. Guides will be careful and interested in telling you all information. Also you can take earphones guides and check all by yourself. In August 2018 ticket price was 30 lira. And if you're a turkish student you can buy museum card just for 20 lira. I recommend all people to visit this place, it's must have in Göreme/Kapadokya trip.	2018-08	5	2	1
296	296	One of The Best place to be witness christians history	Must see & feel goreme open air museum when you are in cappadocia...at least an hour , if have time more, dont miss it...I believe open air museum is the place to feel cappadocia.. its getting cool august & september nights at cappadocia!if you hang out at open cafe around goreme,urgup,avanos,uchisar,ortahisar better have shawl,sweater or jacket...	2018-08	5	2	0
297	297	Excellent attraction	This is world heritage site.These churches have been preserved over the centuries.Very nice area with lot of heritage paintings !	2018-08	5	2	1
298	298	A must do. But early morning !	You can’t come all this way and not go to this.  A tip. If you want to rent the audio guide they will want to see your passport. I dint know why. It seems silly. We didn’t  have ours but in the end it worked out better. Once we were inside we were approached by an official tour guide ,  who after some small haggling became our guide for  €10. This was well worth it. Not only did he give us some really useful information in what we were seeing and what to look for, he also became our photographer and knew exactly where to take the best pictures.  You only need about 1.5 hours for this  and my advice is to do it early morning before the masses of tourist buses and official tours arrive.	2018-08	4	2	1
299	299	One of the most beautiful places on Earth!	I have visited the Goreme Open Air Museum in early August 2018 and it exceeded all my expectations. Not only I enjoyed walking through the cave churches, but i learnt so many new things about early Christianity. The fresco paintings on the walls left me speechless - I felt as if an invisible hand was leading me through the Bible. I am a Muslim but I believe that all religions are to make us closer to one God. Visiting this place is very much worth it.	2018-08	5	2	1
300	300	Very cool place!	We visited here while staying in Goreme and found the open air museum to be well marked with lots of interesting information posted.  There is also an audio tour.  It was crowded when we were there so I highly recommend going early in the day.	2018-08	5	2	1
301	301	wrong picture	Being in Cappadocia one of the places that you have to visit is the open air Museum in Goreme..... Even if it is a crowded place, it is one of the best places to get an idea of Monastic life in the early Middle Ages.A pity that the first picture is NOT in the Open Air Museum of Goreme but a view from the Open Air Museum of Zelve!	2018-07	5	2	1
302	302	The highlight of our 2 day trip!	To say it is a magnificent peek into the past of Christians is somehow just not enough words to explain what you feel when you witness this place! To be actually there where so long ago Christians lived a very harsh life just to be free is an amazing spiritual experience!	2018-08	5	2	1
303	303	Nice	Nice place to visit. Better in the morning because it is less warm in the summer and there are less turists	2018-07	4	2	1
304	304	History lovers must see	We were lucky enough to have our own guide Erogan, organised by the wonderful TJ of TJ tours. He led our little group of 4 most expertly not only with a deep knowledge of the site, it's fascinating Christian history but he structured the visits to the churches in a careful timeline so we could really appreciate and understand what we were seeing. At the same time he managed to ensure that we were not over run and crowded out by some large tour groups. There is much to see here but a good guide, I suggest,  is essential	2018-07	5	2	1
305	305	Just great!	We had great time in Goreme, in general. Many places to visit,and probably this in the most representative of the area. 35 Tl the entrance and 1 hour visit.We loved it!	2018-07	5	2	1
306	306	Gorgeous History	Goreme is really historical and beautiful places. The open air museum was gorgeous. I wish i have time machine and i wish i can see this times. You definitely should see there.. :)	2018-07	5	2	1
307	307	Great site	The Goreme open air museum is an important Byzantine monastic settlement that has a variety of cave churches, monasteries and chapels. The most beautiful of all is the Dark Church.	2018-07	5	2	1
308	308	Definetly must see	We visit this place in our second day in Goreme and it was well worth it.  Plenty climing steps but those small churhes were all very neath to see.  Take water with you, everywhere you go around the attractions are twice as much as price as expected. Do not skip Goreme Open Air Museum, if you follow the signs easy to find as well, or just pull over if driving and ask.	2018-07	5	2	1
309	309	Must ser	Must do this! Audio not worth it and hard to follow. The plaques told just as much. If you can avoid the heat of day you’d enjoy it more. And the shirts in the gift shop can be found for half as much elsewhere.	2018-07	5	2	0
310	310	Great park if you haven't been to other places in Goreme	This was part of the red tour.  Being out all day the day before with the green tour, this was a bit much for us.  Wear flat shoes.	2018-06	4	2	1
311	311	Fantastic ancient cave monasteries with wall paintings	This is a collection of churches that were hewn from the rock and then painted and fresco-ed with various scenes. Some of the best scenes are in the church where you have to pay additional Turkish lira to view but it is well worth 2.00 to 3.00 USD to visit. You walk down to and around the valley to view the different churches from the Roman era.	2018-05	5	2	1
312	312	Close to town	The open-air museum is only few minutes drive from Göreme town. It has a big space of ancient cave monasteries.	2018-07	5	2	0
313	313	Disappointed - Closed	We were disappointed that the museum closed ticket sales a good 45 minutes prior to the closing time stated at the ticket booth without any explanation. Many tourists that arrived well in time to see the museum were refused entry. I would suggest doing this one well ahead of closing time just to be sure seeing as the official closing time is not kept to.	2018-06	1	2	1
314	314	Amazing	The museum is outstanding. Visiting the different caves, the wall paintings and just thinking when they were constructed is just amazing.The wall paintings, their age and the beauty just leave you in awe.Fully worth the time to visit the museum	2018-06	5	2	1
315	315	Amazing place hidden gems	It’s spectacular place if you go to Göreme must do trip if you are into history it was amazing to see all old churches with paints from 1000s years ago Highly recommend to see this place	2018-06	5	2	1
316	316	Amazing	If you join to Cappadocia you must have to visit the Open Air Museum.Absolutely amazing!!! 5/5 for me	2018-06	5	2	1
317	317	One of a kind!	Likely the highlight of our Cappadocia trip, explore the one-of-a -kind cave monasteries of Cappadocia here.	2018-03	5	2	1
318	318	Postcard Cappadocia	"If the image the fairy chimneys of Cappadocia got you here, surely you must the ""UNESCO Open Air Museum"" to properly understand this remarkable phenomenon ! It is essential you go there with a guide, who will not only take you through the myriad of churches and caves, but also give you the Greek Byzantine history and background.It is true that the crowds can be too much, creating waiting lines before you can enter a church or get up a stairway. It is also unacceptable that no photos are allowed inside the churches , after all that is mainly what this museum is all about and visitors like to take a visual momentum with them (understandably, flash photography should be forbidden)."	2018-05	4	2	1
319	319	Morning tour	Great tour to understand and see everything related to cave churches, houses and the old houses in town. Very interesting!	2018-06	5	2	0
320	320	Unique place	Nice, beautiful and clean placeVery unique rock formations Beautiful Byzantine cave churches Worthy to pay extra admission for dark church	2018-05	5	2	1
321	321	Amazing Open Air Museum, an UNESCO cultural site.	"The Goreme Open Air Museum is a must-see place when visiting Cappadocia. It is within walking distance from Goreme center, however, it is an uphill walk. The site is really big an unique with lots of ""churches"" and paintings inside the caves. The history behind it is really interesting, so make sure you get the audio guide in case you are visiting without an actual guide. The views are stunning, and you should allow yourself at least half a day to visit the whole site. There are many little souvenir stores up there before the entrance as well. In my opinion, there is no need to buy a package with a tour to visit. You can do it on your own."	2018-05	5	2	1
322	322	Nice outdoor museum	Nice outdoor museum with amazing rock formations. The day time was quite hot when we visited so better to keep a cap along	2018-04	4	2	1
323	323	Impressive	The Göreme Open Air Museum is a must-see in Göreme. A guide will be a good idea if you are unfamiliar with Byzantine cave churches. There are no maps available, but the site is more or less arranged in a loop. There are a lot of stairs for some of the sites.	2018-05	5	2	1
324	324	Amazing history	Thoroughly enjoyed exploring this museum. Completely new experience. Spent about two hours here in a thunderstorm which added to the atmosphere.	2018-05	5	2	1
325	325	It's optional...	"After spending four days walking through valleys and also visiting nearby city (where you can explore a lot of cave dwellings, cave church and beautiful rock formations), this open air museum became mediocre for me.You could enjoy this museum if you are interested in frescoes, but you might not be able to appreciate them properly because of the crowd...it's too crowded indeed.If you buy the Museum Pass Cappadocia, you can come to this museum just for making your card worth the money. In the museum, there is the ""Dark Church"" where you can use the Museum Pass for the extra ticket :)"	2018-04	2	2	1
326	326	Expected more	In general good place to feel Cappadocia, but it is too much in such small area with so many people. Karanlik kilesi was excellent, but many other churches looks very similar.	2018-05	3	2	0
327	327	Worth while to see - Lot of Christian history	The open air museaum is fantastic. Wear comfortable shoes. Lots of rooms which have no light - you need flashlight or use your cell phones light. They say no flash photography in a lot of rooms but you can use your light on your phone to see the images on the walls.  Lots of Christian history.... worth to see. Took Red tour.	2018-05	5	2	1
328	328	Incredible- a must see	It is one of true gems of the world with lots of Christian history and cave church and houses.. have comfortable shoes, lots of water with you as you see this area...	2018-05	5	2	1
329	329	Worthwhile, but keep your ticket	This is a worthwhile experience, but ensure you meep your ticket to access the church which is outside the main complex and near the car park and toilets. There are numerous amazing churches cut into the rock that were reminiscent of the rock hewn churches of Ethiopia. You can't take pictures inside the churches which is a pity as some have amazing frescoes. Inside the houses are tables cut out of the rock. There is only an explanation for each church and very little for the other buildings so it may pay to hire a audio guide.	2018-05	5	2	0
330	330	Amazing site	This open air museum is an amazing site to visit in Goreme! Would highly recommend it. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, it can get crowded so head in early. Entry fee is 30TL pp and an extra 10TL pp if you want to visit the dark museum which is another church which has the most well preserved paintings. Not sure it's worth the extra money given the paintings were much the same in other churches. If you are thinking about whether or not to pay extra to go in, look at the signboard before you go up the stairs to the dark museum - the picture on it is exactly what it is inside.	2018-05	4	2	1
331	331	Highlight of Goreme	Must visit in Goreme, big area to walk , so ensure you take walking shoes and hat. This comes under the Red Tour circuit.	2018-04	5	2	1
332	332	It is a must to see	Absolutely interesting place. It has an entrance fee of €6. You can walk or hire a taxi for around €3 or see it as part of a day tour. This is an open air museum of cave houses, cave churches and the environment which nomads used to live. You have to put at least 2 hours for a good strolll arpund. We went on foot from Goreme to there and really enjoyed it. There are many places to have tea and coffee, food or shop for souvenirs. Prices are cheaper than Goreme. .	2018-04	5	2	1
333	333	Amazing experience	This is an open air museum located in a big area. So you have to be ready for tracking if you are willing to visit here. Lots of holly places in the caves and wall pictures in the caves are fantastic. Landscape is amazing too and thinking of how people lived in those times lets you to make a time travel.	2018-05	5	2	1
334	334	Best of Turkey	This area and museum is the reason I took the tour of Turkey.  Incredible outdoor scenery combined with centuries old cave churches with inspiring paintings make for one of the best sites in the country.  This is a definite must see if you are visiting the country.	2018-04	5	2	1
335	335	Wonderful Experience!	The man made caves hold beautiful paintings and carvings in churches and eating and kitchen facilities. The oldest paintings are from the 8th century with most being from 12th and 13th centuries. Don’t miss the Dark Cave and the cave near the bus park. Do purchase a Museum Pass Turkiye if you are traveling around the country and skip the long, hot lines. They are available at the museums, especially in Istanbul.  It is 210 Turkish lira, around $50 US. There are also regional and city passes.	2018-04	5	2	0
336	336	Opin air Museum	Great palce .. if you are in Goreme,you have to visit it .. we walked from the center of goreme to it for 30 min.. it worth it .. the views are beautiful	2018-04	5	2	1
337	337	Göreme Open Air Museum	We planned this on our last day at Cappadocia. We went there on foot from our hotel “Roma Cave Suites” Göreme. It’s a nice historic place with no of Churches and chapels.	2018-04	4	2	0
338	338	Crowded, but nice churches	All the coach tourists get there, so the small churches are crowded a f.Also you have to pay extra for the most beautiful dark church, that's just grabbing for tourists money. The churches and sights in there are nonetheless beautiful	2018-04	3	2	0
339	339	A must see in Cappadocia	This place is the main reason to come to Cappadocia. It is unique and full of history. You can consider getting the audio guide if you don’t have a guide.	2018-04	5	2	1
340	340	A lot of Christian History in Turkey	I would suggest you take a guided tour to tell you all about the history of this complex. if you're brave to take some pictures inside the chapels (it's forbidden ) please don't use the flash because it could damage the fresco.	2018-04	5	2	0
341	341	Well worth visit and great views	This is a must visit place while in the area in my opinion. The open air museum is of decent size and you easily spend 2-3 hours in there. The views from there are spectacular. We were a group and got a group ticket but the line for individual tickets was quite long and on our way out (around 1PM) the line was even longer. So as a suggestion try to get there earlier in the morning.	2018-04	5	2	1
342	342	Goreme Open Air Museum	We worth the visit. Was very near to the hotel and didn't require a tour guide. Stunning views and amazing churches.	2018-04	4	2	1
343	343	A must visit	Göreme open air museum is the one and only museum to see here. Churches and monastry are well preserved. Dark Church should not be missed. Most preserved one here is Dark Church.	2018-04	5	2	0
344	344	Excellent historical preservation	I would recommend getting here early to avoid the crowds that come with the tour buses around mid-morning, also it will be cooler.  The museum will not take a lot of time to explore but it has some beautiful old churches where the frescoes within are very well preserved, the only frustration was no pictures allowed, even if you don’t use flash, I guess they just have a blanket restriction so as to avoid arguments with spectators.  It’s very peaceful inside the churches and definitely don’t forget to visit the Tokali (Buckle) church which is outside across the road from the main entrance to the open air museum, the entrance is included within the ticket.  The only additional fee to pay inside is if you want to see the Dark Church, it’s 10tl per person but it’s also the best preserved church in the complex and a small price to pay to feast your eyes on some superb history and art.	2018-04	5	2	1
345	345	Magical place	With all the caves and everything you really feel like in a magical place. Totally recommend if you visit Kapadokya. Be aware of closing times..	2018-04	5	2	1
346	346	Great views, easy hiking	We visited Cappadocia with a 8 years old child, and even for him it was not hard to climb the mountains. Some cave buildings  are abandoned, and that’s even more interesting to explore	2018-04	5	2	1
347	347	Must visit while in Cappadocia!	About 15 minutes away from Goreme city centre, a little hike that is worthwhile the visit. Entrance fee is TL 30 and audio guide is TL 15. Prepare yourself to be amazed on the history and amaze balls architecture!	2018-03	4	2	1
348	348	Information	It is so good. You should go there and the landscape is excellent to  take pics. I enjoyed there and I took a lot of photos in Acikhava Muzesi. There was a lot of tourists.	2018-03	5	2	1
349	349	Beautiful place that still has a special aura	Being an orthodox, I just couldn't miss this gem. It's beautiful, mesmerizing and very touching. You can still see Byzantine crosses, typical orthodox frescos and icons. The dark church is 10 liras extra and totally worth it. I didn't want to leave. I could feel God's presence even after all these years. Too bad many faces are damaged, but that's part of human history. Make sure to avoid large groups of Chinese tourists. They are loud and very disrespectful, laughing inside the caves and prancing around in search of a better photo op.	2018-03	4	2	0
350	350	Pay the additional 10L to see the Dark Church	If you have any interest in the Early Christian Church, it is a must-see. Before there were the massive cathedrals and basilicas of Europe, these chapels and monasteries were carved out of/into caves. The Dark Church is worth the extra fee. The guides are happy to show you all the hidden gems in the paintings. Just a short walk from town, you can wander about at your own pace, take in the vistas, stop in other similar sites along the way—walk up the hill to see another small church complex, or down (towards town) to see the Al Nazar church—highly recommended over doing a motor coach tour trying to cover everything. I went during the off season (March) and was alone until three buses showed up with tour groups at the same time. To avoid this (and the heat) making this an early morning stop might be the best option for having some elbow room.	2018-03	5	2	0
351	351	Awesome	Must see if you visit Capadoccia. But be careful: although it is outdoors it has a 30 TL entrance fee. You should get a MüzeKart	2018-03	5	2	0
352	352	The. Church	Exceptional and dreamy I recomend this place from the bottom of my heart . will go back there it does desserve to be seen again. Everyone should have the feeling that i had there. Dont miss it .its one in the lifetime	2018-02	5	2	0
353	353	Excellent!	Can be visited in any wheather conditions, it was snowing during my visit. Excellent place   must be visited in Goreme	2018-01	5	2	1

356	356	Good hike and History	Different era and a must see with hidden homes in caves. Part of our tour and the guide explained alot. There is an entrance fee but i apologize i am not aware how much as it was included for us.	2018-01	5	2	1
357	357	A must-visit in Cappadocia	"Just come and see this place with your oun eyes. Stunning alother-planet-like views and deep impression of understanding that people ages ago built huge living and religious 	agglomerations with bare hands excavation of tufa massive... A great pity that huge cultural christian heritage is just vanishing year by year as local authorities do not spend any significant resources for resoration or at least keeping current state of all those stunning cave churches created in VI-IX centuries. plus some frescos support the idea that we are not alone in the universe :-) Do not try to save and take an individual tour - group tours will kill all the impression with short and much too formalistic info from the guide. Just spend a couple of extra dozens USD for an individual guide that will take you thru all churches and tell all legends and historical facts over the place."	2018-01	5	2	1
358	358	History and beauty	Fantastic history in the underground caves and natural beauty. The balloon ride was amazing. Great food and very good guides.	2022-03	5	3	1
359	359	Beautiful	We came here with our tour guide by agncy in istanbul. This place is really amazing, we enjoyed our time there	2021-11	5	3	1
360	360	Cappadocia trip	A must see place when visiting Cappadocia.Tall rock formations, carved caves and ideally the sunset create a magical scenery that all tourists will love.	2021-10	5	3	1
361	361	Useful information to make the best of your trip	"I totally agree with many other travelers here that entire Cappadocia is a worldwide unique place, so I wont waste your time here explaining how wonderful it is (I'll do that in separate attractions reviews).Instead, I'll point out here useful info I learned while planning our trip, and from our experience on the ground.- plan to spend 3-4 days to see everything this unique place has to offer (we did it in 3 days, but needed a serious rest after that down on the coast - 4 days would be more relaxed),- best airport to arrive is Kayseri. This airport is much bigger than the closer Nevsehir airport and has more frequent and better (and cheaper) connections with rest of Turkey. From Kayseri airport, Goreme and Cappadocia are an hour drive,- DO rent a car at Kayseri airport. It is pretty cheap and cars are brand new - I used the ""Avec"" local company - great. You will need a car to explore the area as attractions are scattered in a 100 km radius in all directions. You'll save yourself money and do the sightseeing in comfort, not depending on groups and schedules. Roads are very good, with good signage, maps are working and petrol price is a bargain,- if looking for a hotel with a pool to cool and relax, make sure it has an indoor pool (even in mid August when we visited morning and late afternoon air temperatures are insufficient to have a pleasant outdoor swim - 15-20'C, and also the outdoor pool water is NOT heated),- I suggest ""Anatolian Houses"" hotel - terrific in every way, and so authentic and original, has both - indoor with hammam and sauna and outdoor pool (read that separate review),- restaurants are feast for eyes and stomach, plenty of them - it is really difficult to go wrong with that,- DO BUY the ""Museum Cappadocia"" Pass. It enables you to skip the lines in front of each attraction, and it saves you almost 50% of the fees you'd pay separately. It can be purchased at any site entrance. It pays of just after 4 visits out of 8 included (see my pic),- there's no need for any organized agency tours if you have a car. Everything is well posted and explained in brochures and plaques at every site.- balloon morning flight is a must (the best such I'd ever had, and the cheapest at the same time). This, you must do with an agency. I suggest ""Gorgeous Tours"", find their website. Same applies for the morning/afternoon ATV tours I strongly recommend."	2021-08	5	3	1
362	362	Should Be a Wonder of the World	I will make my glowing review of Goreme NP a quick one, so that you have enough time to book your plane tickets and arrange your ground transportation. Cappadocia should be considered a world wonder. Nowhere else is truly like it…the stunning rock formations, the gorgeous lookout points, the hikes, the food, the people, the animals…I needed to have spent much longer to see most of it. And I only had a day. Please follow me and keep an eye out for location-specific reviews within the park. In the meantime, check out Goreme. It’ll be one of the most authentic, memorable experiences of your life.	2021-05	5	3	1
363	363	Incredible natural experience	It's an incredible experience to visit Goreme National Park. The walk is enjoyable and challenging. In summer, skies are clear and the winds are refreshing.	2021-05	5	3	1
364	364	Beautiful, take a car from the coast and drive here	It is a must visit region if you visit a Turkey. Don’t waste tour time sitting by the pool for 8 days. Get in a bus or car and visit this beautiful region for a few days (3 is fine). You can have delicious local food, fly a balloon and enjoy the hospitality and culture Turkey has to offer.	2021-04	4	3	1
365	365	Like an another  planet	Go and visit in the Spring or Autumn, try to go with a guide in order to find you way easily and to have precious infos. You can’t be disappointed by this incredible area of Turkey!	2021-04	5	3	1

367	367	Beautiful	Very beautiful place. I went there 2 months ago. It was great trip. My guide told me history about the place. It is really great	2020-10	5	3	1
368	368	Walk around	Goreme is a unique town but I liked Uchisar better. You can just walk around goreme and admire all the caves and formations that you will find.	2020-11	4	3	1
369	369	Amazing	One of the best place in Cappadocia, let me write correctly, It is one of the best place in World. Amazing	2020-11	5	3	1
370	370	The national park actually covers a large area	It seems many people are visiting Goreme Open Air museum and reviewing that as Goreme National Park. The National Park, a UNESCO site, but a bit of a catch all really, it is not a specific area. It covers the Rock Sites of Cappadocia as a region including the towns of Nevşehir, Ürgüp and Avanos, the sites of Karain, Karlık, Yeşilöz, Soğanlı and the subterranean cities of Kaymaklı and Derinkuyu. Therefore it would be difficult to pin down a photograph representing a single part ond say this is the National Park. The whole area is fabulous, whether self driving with good pre knowledge of the best roads and valleys or booking the famous Red or Green tours, or both, you will see fantastic Cappadocia.	2020-09	5	3	1
371	371	Must Visit	You are not considered visiting Cappadocia if you are not visiting this generally rich-legacy UNESCO site.	2020-10	5	3	1
372	372	Open-air museum	Open-air museum, our guide said, and it really is. The important amount is sites of interest. Wear comfortable shoes and sun protection.	2020-08	5	3	1
373	373	Amazing	It was a great tour i really enjoyed that place. Our tour guide was veri informative and. My child was very happy there	2020-08	5	3	1
374	374	Amazing	Göreme Open Air Museum is a magnificent open air park for the tour. Many caves are great for exploring. It is good to see “churches” in some of these caves.	2020-02	5	3	1
375	375	Interesting place with full of history	We enjoyed our stay here learning about the history of the area and walking around the chimney rocks.	2019-07	5	3	1
376	376	Experiencing Winter during Spring at Cappadocia	It was snowing during our visit since there was weather anomaly in Cappadocia. The view was quite amazing as if it was from one of the locations on Game of Thrones. The stairs leading to the chapels inside the caves were pretty narrow with no handrail in several spots along the stairs. There was only one way to enter and to exit making it quite crowded at times. As it was snowing during our time there, the stairs become slippery too. You surely need to wear suitable shoes for walking as you need to go through quite a few flight of stairs to visit the ancient chapels inside the cave.Also be mindfull of the narrow stairs if you are travelling with young children and/or elderly people.Please noted that ut is forbidden to take pictures inside the cave due to risk of the camera flash damaging the centuries old painting in chapel's wall. Kindly only take pictures when you are outside of the caves.There were several cafes and souvenir shop inside the open air museum. The price was quite the standard of tourist attraction.	2019-05	4	3	1

380	380	Amazing scenery and history	We walked through the park and were impressed by all the history. The rock formations are out of this world. The rock dwellings are fascinating. The walk seemed short as we kept looking, taking photos and exploring. Well worth the visit	2020-03	5	3	1
381	381	Love	It is a very special and beautiful place, a place where history is experienced .. where it is processed to the finest detail. Roasted coffee and wines are more beautiful than each other. The historical structure in the hotels is another, meaningful with every structure ..	2019-06	5	3	1
382	382	A must-visit place in Cappadocia	You are not counted as visiting Cappadocia if you are not visiting this historically rich-heritage UNESCO site.	2020-03	5	3	1

384	384	Informative and rich in history	Great place for pictures and also to learn about history. Best to go with a tour guide who can explain the various stops and the history behind them. Panaromic views are a joy to look at. Remember to wear a good pair of shoes as place has rock surfaces and some slopes, but very walkable.	2019-04	5	3	1
385	385	Astounding	This is an astonishing sight. Definitely justified even despite the walk however pick your time as it can get very hot in the sands. Extremely beautiful and some extraordinary photography choices. Try not to miss this.	2020-02	4	3	1
386	386	Marvelous	An absolute necessity. Everything about Cappadocia is simply unadulterated enchantment. The vitality partook in the city is mind blowing. This is probably the best spot to see and get lost	2020-02	4	3	1
387	387	interesting	We like it very much. Be careful, very slippery stones. Very interesting paintings on te walls of churchis.	2019-09	5	3	1
388	388	Magical land	We visited  Goreme in Oktober 2019. It was part of our honeymoon trip and we are still sad because we didnt spent at least couple days more at this magical place.We have heard about is before we came, we saw photos and videos, but believe me you cannot describe how beautiful this place is.It is perfect in September or October to visit since during the summer it is too hot.You can stay at cave hotels, visit open air museum, take one of the tours to visit couple more villages and underground cities and learn more about their tradition, culture and history of course. Prepare yourself to wake up early in the morning and visit Point of View place (ask locals) about directions and enjoy the view over the valley lighten by morning sun and hot air ballons.	2019-10	5	3	1
389	389	Interesting	This is a delightful spot to visit with mind boggling rock developments. You will see delightful landscape like no other. Just astonishing.	2020-02	5	3	1
390	390	Interesting	It is a hypnotizing place. We got a vehicle rental in off season and it was an incredible method to investigate the district and keeping away from enormous visit gatherings.	2020-01	5	3	0
391	391	Very Nice!	"In the event that you are in the Cappadocia Region, The National Park/Open Air Museum is one of the spots you should see. While you can appreciate the first types of mountain and fairy smokestacks, you can study the early time of Christianity. Particularly beginning from the second century AD, some Christian priests pulled in the consideration of adherents. Subsequently, you can see a few houses of worship created in caverns. A few caverns are under rebuilding and some of them like ""Karanlık Kilise/Dark Church"" requires additional section charge. At the door of the open air museum, you can visit to the trinket shop, bistro, and rest rooms. I for one like the bona fide bistro in one of the caverns."	2019-12	4	3	1
392	392	The Best Combination of Geomorphology, History, and Anthropology	"If you are in the Cappadocia Region, The National Park/Open Air Museum is one of the places you must see. While you can enjoy the original forms of mountain and fairy chimneys, you can learn more about the early period of Christianity. Especially starting from the 2nd century AD, some Christian monks attracted the attention of believers. Thus, you can see several churches developed in caves. Some caves are under restoration and some of them like ""Karanlık Kilise/Dark Church"" requires extra entry fee. At the gate of the open air museum, you can visit to the souvenir shop, cafe, and rest rooms. I personally like the authentic cafe in one of the caves."	2020-01	5	3	1
393	393	Something interesting around every corner	It is a mesmerizing place. We got a car rental in off season and it was a great way to explore the region and avoiding large tour groups.	2020-01	5	3	1
394	394	Spectacular eroded landscape with ancient ruins	Göreme National Park (Turkish: Göreme Tarihî Milli Parkı) protects nearly 100 km2 (39 sq mi) of rocky, water- and wind-eroded landscape with a network of ancient, interconnecting underground settlements, it was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985. Volcanic eruptions 3 to 9 million years ago from nearby Mount Hasan and Mount Erciyes deposited layers of basalt and thick beds of tuff (volcanic ash solidified into a soft rock).   Since then, erosion has carved the area into a spectacular landscape of plateaus and high hills, dissected by streams and steep-sided river valleys.  In places where the soft tuff is overlain by hard lava there is a fantastic landscape of multi-colored cliffs, rock towers, pillars, tent rocks and fairy chimneys.  With only 38cm of precipitation each year, there is little vegetation except in the river bottom lands.  Early settlers carved the soft tuff into dwellings, stables, storehouses, and places of worship.  The earliest Christian monasteries in the area  were the 4th century anchorite communities, following the teachings of Basileios the Great, Bishop of Kayseri, Turkey.  Monks and nuns inhabited cells carved in the rock and offered religious services in tiny churches.   Later, the communities took refuge together in underground villages to avoid attacks by marauding Arabs.  Three of the most-visited areas in the park near Göreme are:-- Göreme Open Air Museum (just east of town), with cave churches and frescoes from the 10th to 12th centuries. -- Uçhisar Castle (southwest of town), a fortification carved into a large outcrop, with panoramic views from the top. -- The landscape at Paşabağ Valley (north of town) is known for its “fairy chimneys,” (cone-shaped rock formations).There are hiking trails and back-country roads allowing exploration of the more remote areas.  Viewing the area from a hot air balloon at dawn is a sublime experience. Water, sturdy foot gear and a guide are recommended if you venture into the back country.  The park is open at all times with no entry fee.	2019-05	5	3	1
395	395	Christian history	you will be amazed if you see the unique churches and frescos that they are there. Its a unique park full of Christian history. Its a must while you are visiting Cappadocia	2019-10	5	3	1
396	396	Deserve	All Cappadocia is lovely. Deserve to go everywhere. Sometimes a little bit boring because everywhere are tourists and everybody stops the car near the rocks and you cant took good pictures for memory.	2020-01	5	3	0
397	397	Wouldn't bother	You can see the rock formations in tonnes of other place where they currently don't charge you. There were tonnes of tourists getting in the way of photos and it really wasnt overly impressive. Save your money.	2019-09	3	3	0
398	398	Stunning	This is a must visit area. It will take your breath away. The cave dwellings are ingenious. Making dwellings out of rock is sheer genius	2019-12	5	3	1
399	399	Amazing work of nature	The unique terrain is a result of volcanic activity and wind erosion over centuries. Rock cut churches and dwellings, pigeon caves, fairy chimneys and valleys dot the area. Amazing work of nature. A sight to behold	2019-08	5	3	1
400	400	Good way to spend a few hours and get close to the formations	We had a good time wandering around this place and get up close and personal with the rock formation. Does require some lec of fitness if you want to see everything. You do have to pay extra to see the dark church which we did not	2019-12	4	3	0
401	401	Beautiful place	Goreme national park is the central area of Goreme and is lovely to walk around. Restaurants and hotels dot this area, along with the fairy chimneys, making it one of the most unique landscapes you will ever see. The hot air balloons in the morning make it even prettier. A once in a lifetime visit!	2019-09	5	3	1
402	402	Mesmerizing history of man	Words cannot describe my experience and you have to be there to believe it see it and experience it. From caves to mountains, oceans, volcanoes, Roman empire, Christianity, pottery, food, and so much more..	2019-12	5	3	0
403	403	Arid Moon Like Landscape !	Do explore the moon-like landscape of this unique and ancient area when you are in the region of Cappadocia, Turkey. There are hundreads of chapels carved into the hillside and the first religious colonies found here dated back to 373AD, is truly an unforgettable and memorable experience.	2019-12	5	3	1
404	404	Goreme National Park.	Touched down in Cappadoyka  in the nite and freezing cold .An unbelievable alien terrain which continued into and from a hit air balloon ride.A totally surprising landscape.Makes one wonder if they are in the right planet.A must ..a different experience altogether. There are many ways to view this area..jeep safaris tours etc	2019-12	5	3	1
405	405	Church among mosques	So many mosques but this was one of the only churches in the area.  The markings and structure are so clear.	2019-11	4	3	1
406	406	totally stunning!	Walking amongst the cave houses and churches is the most amazing thing. You will get very hot as the stone all reflects the sun and heat, so take water to drink and a hat. You can clamber into various houses and churches - unlike anything else anywhere.	2019-10	5	3	0
407	407	First trip	I am a 61year old lady traveling with a slightly disabled daughter for the first time. I had a very pleasant and memorable trip thanks to our guide, Nasim and driver Hussein. Nasim was very accommodating and knowledgeable. They even took us to the Grand Mountains, the name I have forgotten. Nasim did mention it several times.I am also very grateful to Sedunia Travels for arranging the itinerary with special care . Thank you so much.	2019-12	5	3	1
408	408	Beautiful place to visit	This is a beautiful place to visit with incredible rock formations. You will see beautiful scenery like no other. Simply amazing.	2019-11	5	3	1
409	409	interesting	I guess a private tour and with a guide make the trip different.  We were lucky to have Moustafa from Pupa Travel as our guide, he is very knowledgeable and friendly.

411	411	Great area with some really nice hikes	We were in the area a couple of days, very cool area to explore. We found the open air museum hardly worth as much as just walking the area for free	2019-11	4	3	1
412	412	Amazing place	This is a magical place! Where ever you go you are amazed by nature and our the caves some of the first humans made, of course nature and weather have done their thing over thousands of years but it’s awesome all around. Beginning of November it’s definitely the best time a year to visit with a cool weather and not that many tourists, bring a mask or scarf lots of dust in the air.	2019-11	5	3	1
413	413	Interesting place that can get very crowded	I had thought November was low season! We got there at around 9.10am and it wasn’t too crowded, but by the time we walked halfway through the park it was overrun by busloads of tourists. Place is a must go to understand and see the cave living in the past. Would still try to go. Paid 136TL for 3 persons.	2019-11	4	3	0
414	414	Another Ancient Wonder!	This is also one of the must-see in Turkey. Our guide from TSC travel did a great job in giving historic information every step of the way. There's a lot of amazing land formation, the pavements, remaining pillars of the ones famous place, cave like buildings that has drawings and paintings from the ancient times. The theater ruin is another spectacle of this place.The beauty of the scenery is just so wonderful to see. I can really feel and smell how old this place is and the story that comes with it. I can go on and on...but my words can't really describe the ancient wonder of this place.You must wear comfortable shoes though.	2019-10	5	3	1
415	415	Unique Outdoor Museum	The open air museum portion of this park was great!  There are numerous churches carved into the cliffs and fairy chimneys and inside are ancient frescoes and in one case, even a skeleton of an actual saint.  Climb the stairs and check them all out.	2019-02	5	3	0
416	416	worth visiting!	this place is definitely worth visiting, especially with a good guide! you will need comfy shoes/trainers, sunglasses and a hat, too, b/c it's really hot and sunny in autumn!	2019-10	5	3	1

418	418	Amazing view Recommend with kids	October is perfect weather for visiting. National Park is a natural show. Kids love so much. Walking around and climbing to caves was easy for kids. Definitely very clean and people are very helpful. Better to have MuseumCard. Even free for kids you need FreeCard for them. Apart from Main entrance, on the way (just 50m away from parking) one more cave which one is the best for me.	2019-10	5	3	1
419	419	Not to be missed	if you were to choose amongst places to explore this is one park that you should not miss.  It provides an open area museum of Byzantine churches, monastery and plenty of fairy chimneys to choose from.	2019-10	5	3	0
420	420	Amazing Goreme and an out of this world setting	What an outstanding place to be. A fairy tale originating out of the Persian stories with fairy chimneys 360 degrees and thick colorful clouds of balloons flying over your head. Rose valley on one side calling out loud beautiful colors of stone with a sprinkle of rain..... beautiful turkey always do not seize to amaze me.....	2019-07	5	3	1
421	421	beautiful	amazing place, culture, cave, rocks, incridible, how they did everything.I would recommend it for everyone	2019-10	5	3	1
422	422	Amazing rock formations	This area of Turkey presents this amazing rock formations that turn into the oddest shapes, such as camels, dolphins, etc. Is an astounding experience	2019-10	5	3	1
423	423	Astonishing	The landscape throughout the Goreme National Park are other worldly and totally unique.  Formed over millions of years and used by generations since 6000BC, it is truly a World Heritage Area,	2019-10	5	3	1
424	424	Not like any other	This place is a must visit for travellers. No camera could capture the beauty of all the rock formations. It was a very unique experience for my friends and I. I wish to go back someday.	2019-10	5	3	1
425	425	Unbelievable landscape	This place is amazing, the landscape is totally unique and the scene is enhanced nearly every morning by upwards of 150 hot air balloons making the whole experience surreal. It's worth driving around the surrounding area as there are so many different vistas to see. The town of Goreme itself is charming and the many restaurants varied and cheap.	2019-09	5	3	1
426	426	Göreme National Park	Visited the Göreme National Park on FourTrack, it was a great tour and scenery was beautiful. I highly recommend it.	2019-09	5	3	1
427	427	Amazing Rock formations	These unusual rock formations known as “fairy chimneys.” These natural wonders are augmented by the cultural heritage of the region’s inhabitants, who as far back as the third century hewed homes, churches and entire underground cities into the landscape.Goreme National Park is on the UNESCO’s World Heritage List. Surely it is a must visit.	2019-09	5	3	1
428	428	Rocky scenery _1st place we visit in the area	This was the first attraction for us to visit, so maybe we were more impressed about the rocky and dry scenery here, then in the others places we visit after. We didn't tag along with groups but still it was rather crowded, because museum is actually smaller then we initially thought (it seemed overwhelmingly big). Overall a nice experience (nature mixed with stories)	2019-10	4	3	1
429	429	Goreme	beautiful place.  for different types of trip.  unique landscape.very good food in restaurants and lots of shops	2019-10	5	3	1
430	430	An area worth visiting	The chimneys are a sight to behold, such a place. Such natural beauty. It is a privilege to be able to visit.	2019-10	5	3	1
431	431	Very Impressive	While we have seen similar geological landscapes elsewhere in the world, what is most impressive here is the tremendous concentration of man-made underground structures.  There are multiple underground early Christian churches, monasteries, and hundreds of residences concentrated in a fairly small area. It takes some hiking up and down hilly paths to see the largest ones, and plenty of patience to deal with the hordes of foreign tourists.  The paintings and decorations in the most important churches are deteriorating badly, but still visible and quite impressive.  Do not miss!	2019-10	5	3	0
432	432	Mind blowing	A must. Everything about Cappadocia is just pure magic. The energy shared in the city is mind blowing. This is one of the best places to see and get lost	2019-10	5	3	1
433	433	Global wonder	The whole goreme region is made up of special landscape by volcanic eruption and wind erosion over the thousands of years. They have taken various shapes and they have been named imaginatively like chimney, peacock, camel and what not. The whole thing is very very interesting and absolutely worth visiting.	2019-06	5	3	1
434	434	Breathe taking	Just an amazing place unfortunately the Chinese were on mass constantly taking pictures of themselves,,,	2019-09	5	3	0
435	435	Nice Park	It was a nice park but it got too tiring trekking through all of it. Had to take plenty of breaks to complete it. It was hot as well.	2019-05	5	3	1
436	436	Amazing	What a wonderful place - if you told me it was the moon I would believe you.  The stone colours and formations are amazing and it goes on for miles and miles.  A great place to visit and wander around and with a glorious history as well.	2019-10	5	3	1
437	437	Red Tour Stop	So, we took part in a tour (Red Tour), which covered the main landmarks of North Cappadocia and Goreme Open Air Museum was one of the stops. It is an amazing place, like a miracle of the nature, the home of many monasteries and chapels built by the Christians that populated the area starting with the 3rd century.There is also a very nice place, built in the rocks where we had Turkish coffee. If you want to buy specific Turkish sweets (such as Turkish delight) do it from Goreme not from there. You will find more sortiments at better prices. However Goreme Open Air Museum is worth visiting for the view and the culture it has to offer.	2019-10	5	3	1
438	438	Goreme National Park	Surely a must visit if in the Goreme area.Many examples of early Christian art together with cave dwellings.Please note that there is a very interesting church just outside the main complex which is probably the most interesting? Visiting this church is part of the Museum ticket	2019-09	5	3	1
439	439	WONDERFULL	guys wonderful place to see, i can not belive this nature and people are really kind. Turkey has lots of beuty.	2019-09	5	3	1
440	440	A Spiritual Experience	This was an amazing place to visit! There's so much history and it was quite meaningful to see the various churches hidden in the rocks. Make sure you're wearing proper shoes with good traction. There's a lot of climbing and you need good footing to get around the various structures.	2019-08	5	3	1
441	441	A throwback to medieval times	This is around 20 minutes walk from Goreme center but it is worth every minute.  The complex is huge and consists of a series of cave churches.  The most preserved church paintings are situated in a cave church for which an additional fee has to be paid.  But it is worthwhile.	2019-09	5	3	0
442	442	Amazing ancient Byzantine cave dwellings.	A facinating must visit Byzantine cave dwelling complex with catacombs, skeletons, ancient paintings, scenes of religious persecution - an ode to human endurance and spirit	2019-09	5	3	1
443	443	Amazing	This is an amazing sight. Well worth the walk but pick your time as it can get quite hot in the sands. Very picturesque and some great photography options. Do not miss this.	2019-09	5	3	1
444	444	A different experience	A great place to visit if you're interested in historical information, geology, and archaeology.It features a rocky, water- and wind-eroded landscape with a network of ancient, interconnecting underground settlements.	2019-09	4	3	1
445	445	Cutouts on Rocky Mountains	Stretching a vast area with hills and mountains, Goreme National Park remains so close to our hearts. Our guide was always helpful that he explained about the rock formations  and nature made art work on such mountains.	2019-04	5	3	1
446	446	Out of the world experience	I cannot compare Cappadocia with anywhere in the world. It is really out of this world. I took 3 days trek to the valley which brought me the best experience about the beauty of the nature. The trek is not too tough for everyone, it is just a walk around. We were surrounded by the roses smell and the birds singing.Everyone should at least discover Cappadocia once in lifetime.	2019-04	5	3	1
447	447	Very distinct national park	Goreme national park covers the entire area from Nevsehit to Urgup. The whole area are so unique, beautiful and so different compared to other national parks in the world.The region has been inhabited more than 2000 years. Since pre Christian period, people has been living in this place because of good location, very secure and mild weather.However, the most interesting part of this area is the distinct rock formation which has many kinds of rock shape. The center of the national park is mainly in Goreme, Urgup and Avanos.Three days is the minimum days to spend in this area. Lots of activities can be done like hot air balloon which is a must, atv ride, horseriding and etc.I would highly recommend this place and rated as number one attraction in Turkey. A place not to be missed while in Turkey	2019-06	5	3	1
448	448	Very interesting	Is interesting because is in open air...is like a big park. Is member of Unesco World Heritage since 1984, and is one of the first  two Unesco sites in Turkey.Is near Goreme village center...about 15 minutes walk. You must see it.	2019-08	5	3	1
449	449	First introduction to Cappadocia region	After the drive from the airport and commentary by our guide, this was our first taste of the actual churches and dwellings of the region.  The shows on TV did not prepare us for how large and extensive this region and the number of carved volcanic tufa structures.  Highly recommended, but try to avoid times when the big tour buses hit.	2019-09	5	3	1
450	450	Rock, Sand and Caves	Goreme National Park is full of rocks, sand and caves.  A unique place to visit and with historical stories about the place in Turkish history.  It takes time to walk, take photos and travel around this place. Though summer is hot, many times wind to keep us dry.	2019-08	5	3	1
451	451	Fascinating history	This was an amazing place to learn about geology and the history of our region.   We hired a guide for the day and he made it come alive.  Unfortunately, it is over-run with bad tourists just trying to take selfies.   They didn’t respect the property and were more interested in their ego pictures.   It was hard to enjoy completely with all of the bad behavior.	2019-09	4	3	1
452	452	Worth a visit	See how people lived a thousand years in these churches/monasteries. A place like no other so definitely worth a visit for the uniqueness and stunning views. Try the Turkish coffee in the little cafe, they make it on sand - it's really good and I don't even like coffee!	2019-09	4	3	1
453	453	Must See	This is a must see in Cappadocia. We were on a tour and we knew nothing before we got here . We are happy we saw this	2019-09	5	3	1
454	454	Good for those who are interested in History	Goreme National Park is full of early christian history. The place is always crowded. There are toilets at the entrance. Use it before going inside. There is a museum shop also. Take atleast a water bottle with you. There is lot of walking around inside and a little bit of uphill walk also. Lots of old churches with fresco art. The churches were carved out of the rocks. Good place for photography. I was surprised that so many people were smoking inside. It should not be allowed. Yes it is not a closed space but still its a heritage site and smoking should not be allowed. Going early morning makes no difference, the place is always crowded. Take a camera along and enjoy.	2019-08	4	3	1
455	455	Cappadocia is not a place to rush through, its worth to take your time.	As we visited Turkey on a tight schedule, we had planned the trip and booked our hotels, so it is ashamed that we did not get to spent more time in Cappadocia. It is an extraordinary place with so many history and beauty. We visited Goreme on a rainy day, so our photos end up looking gloomy. But it was still special to get to see all the fairy chimneys up close, we never would though we will get to be there in person after seeing the place only though photos. It was magical, and we had the honour to visit one of the chimney house, to have tea and talk to the house owners. It was a wonderful experience.	2018-12	4	3	1
456	456	Historical	A beautiful and enigmatic place with plenty of history.  Lovely frescos in the churches that were carved out of the rock.  As can be expected it is very busy with tourists.  It is an exposed site so take care in hotter weather and take with you a hat, sun protection and water.	2019-06	5	3	0
457	457	So interesting and a very worthwhile trip	The chapels in the fairy chimneys features incredible frescoes so worth seeing.  It was crowded with tourists and the steps up to some places a bit squashed.  I would definitely recommend going early or planning a trip there out of the peak tourist season.	2019-08	5	3	1
458	458	Wonderful Experience	Lovely place to go hiking and climbing. Bring lots of water, apply sunblock, wear a hat, light jacket if you don’t like the sun beating down on your skin, and at least wear sneakers. Have fun!	2019-08	4	3	1
459	459	Great view and experience	Great experience. Nice photo places if you climb the hill. You have an area for food, drinking, and good restroom. Wheelchair accessible area. Kids will like the camel ride.	2019-08	5	3	1
460	460	Fascinating	Pros:• spectacular scenery, you’ll want to take hundreds of photos• fascinating history. Cons:• it helps to have a guide to make the most of your visit• make sure you are prepared for the heat.	2019-08	4	3	1
461	461	Arriving early won’t save you...just be patient.	It’s always crowded. You’ve read several reviews claiming that early morning was empty - this is quite inaccurate, even at 9am (opening time) the site was already packed with buses and tours, hence be patient.They do accept the Turkey Museum Pass which will also give you access to the church on the other side of the road and the Dark Church.	2019-08	3	3	0
462	462	Incredible place	So many hikes easy to do by yourself, incredible landscapes.. Lot of activities available. Amazing, I will go back for sure	2019-08	5	3	1
463	463	Waste of money	i think this place was quite useless, there was nothing inside that one can otherwise not see outside if they went for a hike. there were some glorifications of antiquity and religion related themes. i think it's unfair to charge for religion themed tourism. There is so much more history, structure and meaning to the caves we have in India. Not recommended and that too, on a hot summer day. i was exoevting the different kind of rock structures. they should have clearly named this as a Christian remains museum!	2019-08	1	3	1
464	464	Beautiful	Such a beautiful place! I could just sit and look around for hours. However, do avoid it during the summer! It was unbelievably hot and busy.	2019-08	5	3	1
465	465	Must visit in Goreme	If you’re in Göreme and surrounds, the open air museum is a must see to get a real feel of the surroundings.Easily accessible, very exposed and hot, so plan accordingly!	2019-08	4	3	1
466	466	Fascinating! Don’t miss this one!	Natural formations are simply amazing! A photographer’s dream! Kids will enjoy exploring this area too.	2019-07	5	3	1
467	467	Amazing UNESCO site	Göreme is a town in the Cappadocia region of central Turkey. Just east of town is the Göreme Open Air Museum, with cave churches and frescoes from the 10th to 12th centuries. Southwest is Uçhisar Castle, a fortification carved into a large rock, with panoramic views from the top. To the north, the landscape at Paşabağ Valley is known for Cappadocia’s “fairy chimneys,” cone-shaped rock formations.	2019-07	5	3	1
468	468	Incredible sites	This is a very historic landscape.  So many things to see and do.  Get out and explore.  The old cave dwellings in the park have some ancient fresco style paintings on the walls that are many centuries old.  You must plan a hot air balloon ride also!  It’s magical!	2019-07	5	3	1
469	469	Amazing geological formations	This place is simply amazing . I do not think there is elsewhere like this anywhere in the world. You see cave Churches - apparently one for  Everyday of the year . The paintings on the walls inside are awesome . This is a photographer’s paradise . There are some steps but nothing too steep . Expect to spend 2-3 hrs here taking photos.	2019-08	5	3	1
470	470	Mr myers	Absolutely stunning! We had a wonderful time and will love to do It again. Great opportunity for pictures and the guide was wonderful	2019-08	5	3	1
471	471	Half of the reviews here are for the Goreme Outdoor Museum!	I recommend the Goreme National Park as a whole but because it includes alot of separate attractions, Fairy Chimneys, etc. and the confusion with the Outdoor Museum I think the TA editors need to look at this.	2019-08	4	3	1
472	472	A complex of churches and dormitories that housed over 2000 people!!	A UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the largest open air museums in the world. Many number of rocks that were carved into churches, cafeterias and dormitories. Very fascinating to see the architecture. One giant rock with caves that was the male dorm and another giant rock for females.The churches have murals in their interiors. It's unfortunate that murals are eroding due to people either scratching them off, taking photos with flashes, and just sheer volume of tourists. The humidity caused by the breathing of tourists also contribute to the erosion. Although flash photography is not allowed, there were some ignorant tourists taking photos with flashes. So I informed the security sitting outside the entrance. There is one church that costs an extra 10-15TL to get in (I heard it has more well-preserved murals). It really is quite amazing to see a university carved into rocks that accommodated more than 2000 people studying the bible.	2019-07	5	3	1
473	473	so much history.. a lovely place	great place to see fairy chimneys up close. plus you see so much historically important way to living, during the olden days.it just blows your mind. a must do in cappadocia for sure	2019-05	5	3	1
474	474	Fairy chimneys up close!	This is a great place to see the fairy chimneys up close and the beautiful mosaics in the cave churches. Plan to spend some time here to explore and learn about the unique landscape of Cappadocia.	2019-06	5	3	1
475	475	Real nature	İt was a whole heaven out there we had a lof of fun there no matter how the weather is cold or hot its beautiful in every season	2019-07	5	3	1
476	476	Beautiful place	A place full of history and christianity. You can go there by yourself or you cand take a private tour.	2019-06	5	3	0
477	477	Fairy Chimneys Fairy Tales	Unique Fairy chimneys will lead you to feel the Fairy tales lives. Hot air balloon tour goes over there, don’t miss the chance to be there	2019-07	4	3	0
478	478	Interesting!	A must visit in cappadocia. You get to see all the old churches in their fairytaleLandscape . It does get hot so remember to carry sunscreen and a hat! And goodWalking shoes :)	2019-07	4	3	1
479	479	A must visit - beautiful views and stunning history	An impressive site not to be missed whilst in the Cappadocia region. The 4000 year old history here is simply incredible. The paintings in the churches are unbelievable to see. Our family thoroughly enjoyed our time here, and it was made all the richer by having our fabulous guide Eda with us for the day sharing all her knowledge. Highly recommend visiting, and if you can your experience will be that much better with a guide (you can find Eda on the Tours By Locals website - the best guide in Turkey!).	2019-07	5	3	1
480	480	Impressive Historical Site	This is a not to miss when in Goreme. The cave churches and frescoes were amazing. Built into the landscape of the area, the UNESCO World Heritage site is a gem. Be prepared to walk uphill and have a hat and water.	2019-07	5	3	1
481	481	Amazing place a must	Very amazing place how human could utilize this kind of natural. All construction by nature are very impressive.	2019-07	5	3	1
482	482	breathtaking views	The park is beautiful  with many picture perfect moments. Can visit caves with rustic furniture. has a little cafe where you can get something to eat and drink. Can also purchase little tokens and souvenirs from here,	2019-06	5	3	1
483	483	A bucket list visit	This is an exceptional site on most world travelers’ bucket lists. The mural paintings in the churches are some of the best to see in Turkey. It is worth paying the extra fee to enter the cave churches. The cave dwellings are fairly well preserved but some subsidence and reconstruction work is done after heavy rains. One can see the stone tables, benches and cooking areas. Great to hike around and between the natural stone marvels.	2019-07	5	3	1
484	484	Out of this world	Seeing is believing it was absolutely fantastic and well worth the long journey to get there. If you are within 6 hours by road it really is something else. You should book a hotel for 1-3 nights to make the most of your time there.	2018-10	5	3	1
485	485	Must see  while in Kapadokya!	I really enjoyed walking around and paid the extra to see inside the church. It's like nothing else I've ever seen.	2019-06	5	3	0
486	486	Beautiful scenery	A beautiful and historical area surrounded by valleys and filled with caves. Most of it is open for free for the public. It was an unusual and a unique experience for us.	2019-07	5	3	1
487	487	Walking on the Moon !	the place is extraordinary amazing and its just like Kandovan village in IRAN ... i had kots of walking and hiking there . and also it is better to go for a walk on early morning	2019-06	5	3	1
488	488	Sunset Horse ride	What a beautiful guided horse outride through the mountains with my wife... Magical sunset as you take in the atmosphere..After a morning balloon ride over the valley, this was a perfect way to see the valley up close and personal on horseback	2019-05	5	3	1
489	489	Awesome	Pretty cool place to visit and see the fairy chimney.  gets pretty busy with tour groups but still fun to explore	2019-06	5	3	1
490	490	Most amazing place	Goreme is a must do place to visit. The landscape is incredible and if you can organise a hot air balloon trip do!	2019-06	5	3	1
491	491	Fascinating Cave Churches	Amazing what locals created over 1000 years ago.  Multiple churches with frescoes have survived .  The history is palpable with every step.  A must see while in Cappadocia.	2019-06	5	3	0
492	492	Recommend for everyone who visit Cappadocia	It is a must experience to understand Cappadocia’s history.I always visit this park with my guest. There are severely churches and to walk around to feel the valley is always make me feel good.	2019-06	5	3	0
493	493	Great	Great park. Super fun to visit. Nice hiking trails with many unique formations. Like another planet. Truly worth a visit.	2019-06	4	3	1
494	494	Beautiful	The whole of cappadocia has such stunning natural beauty that one has to visit to feel and explore its beauty...There are beautiful rock formations. The fairy chimneys also add to the beauty if the landscape. The goreme church is beautifulWe took a hotair baloon over cappadocia which was the highlight of the trip.. The sunrise over cappadocia was stunning with coloured hotair balloons lighting up all around. We flew over pigeon valley, fairy chimneys upto Urgrup castle. Finally champagne on landing... U can also take the Red or Green tour which shows the Underground cities and how the people lived so many hundred years ago.. The whole town with burial areas were underground.. Amazing network of tunnels and stairs that u dont realize that Derinkuyu goes down to 60metres below ground !!Cappadocia is A Must Visit and the balloon ride is once in a life experienceFor the balloon we took Sky Balloons and a 16-18 people balloon as prices vary according to number of ppl in a balloon. Average 180-200 euros pp. U can negotiate. Tip: Get in the Balloon the last as u will then have the corner !!	2019-03	5	3	1
495	495	Pictures can’t capture it	Pictures can’t do justice to the majesty of this landscape.  The ash and lava rock has created a unique visual not found anywhere else that I have seen.  While local tour guides state the landscape was created 30 million years ago, it was obviously created during and shortly after Noah’s flood, which both Christianity and Islam believe.	2019-06	4	3	1
496	496	a must see	Short walk and a must see. Amazing. Beautiful natural beauty.in the rocks, there are houses... ıts so cool	2019-05	5	3	1
497	497	Must see	Short walk and a must see.  Amazing. Go later in the day because the busses arrive early and it can be packed.	2019-04	5	3	1
498	498	Valley walking gives the best impression	During a three day walking tour bthrough different parts of the Goreme Hills and park area, it gives avery good impression of the natural beauty of the area. The sizes of the geological formations are best appreciated from below.	2019-06	5	3	1
499	499	Beautiful natural beauty	Spent half a day in this beautiful spot. Lots to look at, so much history! Beautiful churches with intricate paintings.	2019-05	5	3	1
500	500	amazing landscape, human craft	the open air museum has a very chap entrance fee and it is totally worth it. the landscape is amazing and the views too. in the rocks, there are houses, churches and rooms that it is amazing how people made them! go early, avoid the crowds!	2019-05	5	3	1
501	501	A must see while in Cappadocia	Went to the Outdoor Museum with a private guide and so worth while. Incredible to think that an ancient population lived in these caves. Definitely worth a visit	2019-06	4	3	1
502	502	History	Cinfirmation that there were Christians in the area.Are. Identical to the Orthodox Churches as interior arhitecture and biblical scenes painted on the walls.	2019-06	5	3	0
503	503	A must see place in Cappadocia	1. Listed on UNESCO2. Comprises of, Goreme Open Air Museum, Zelve, Urgup, Ortahisar, Uchisar. 3. Consider buying a Museum Card, it will be cheaper. 4. Travel by car.*Went on April and it was a snowy day so we couldn’t enjoy to the fullest. So if you like sunny days should check the weather before your trip, if possible.	2019-04	5	3	1
504	504	plenty of hiking trails, and gorgeous scenery.	during the summer is preferable to go and do some hiking and take water because it gets hot. the hiking scenario is amazing and gorgeous. plenty of caves to see and check out.	2019-06	5	3	1
505	505	2019 Eid Holiday	due to eid it was really crowded however we enjoyed a lot with my family.. definitely we suggest all region to see amazing environment	2019-06	5	3	1
506	506	Magical	We experienced a balloon ride over the National Park what an amazing spectacular of landscapes... the chimneys of sandstone the Forrest of greenery pine trees...we were there at sunrise it is beautiful definitely visit the national park.	2019-06	5	3	1
507	507	Challenging walk but wort the scenery	It was not that easy walking around this national park as it was ups and downs, and steeps at some parts. However, the scenery we saw was worth the walk. It was a nature at its best!	2019-06	4	3	1
508	508	Amazing trip (especially with jeep in tow)	Totally worth the spending on a jeep with driver, to bring us to panoramic spots to take photos with the majestic backdrops. Set off from our hotel at 5am and back at 7am. A well worth 2 hours of phototaking at a spot which forms part of my bucket list. Cost us USD 110 per pax. You may be able to find cheaper fares elsewhere as we booked ours through a group tour operator.	2019-06	5	3	1
509	509	Wow, and that's a big Wow!!	What an amazing and unique landscape. When you consider that this method of living was first done en masse by the Hitites and so much of it still remains to this day having suffered earthquakes, floods etc.You have to come and experience the wonderfully innovative way that they built dwellings in the rocks going upwards and also underground cities going downwards using chisels and hard work!  Amazing! So happy that I chose to add this part to my recent tour of Caucasus.	2019-05	5	3	1
510	510	The Most Unique Landscape in the World	Goreme National Park is fantastic !.The Landscape changes constantly as it is volcanic and it can only be described as looking like the surface of the moon.The Fairy Chimneys are special and you will get great photos without people around you.I would recommend getting a guide by the name of Busra from Pulsar Turizm..she was fantastic and very knowledgeable.Most sites have souvenir sellers and places to buy drinks and food.Spend at least 8 hours on a tour and you will love it !	2019-06	5	3	1
511	511	The landscape and history will blow your mind.	Step into history as you explore the cave dwellings and natural wonders in the rose, love and pigeon valleys.	2019-05	5	3	1
512	512	Nice	It’s a very nice place, a must go when visiting Capadoccia. You walk though what was a Village located around a valley, with many carved houses with its different rooms (stable, kithchen, bedroom...). You can also get inside an ancient church that still has a few signs of paintings on the walls and also a small mosk. I recommend to spend at least 30-40 min to do the full walk around The Valley.	2019-06	5	3	0
513	513	kapadokia national park very beautiful sunset and sunrise beautiful mountain very beautiful place old and historical	kapadokia national park very beautiful sunset and sunrise beautiful mountain very beautiful place old and historical  location you can enjoying a lot	2019-06	5	3	1
514	514	Good visit but gets very busy	Did this as part of a booked tour - great to visit but it gets super busy which means you're literally in and out of each room.	2019-06	4	3	1
515	515	Goreme Open Akr Museum	Fascinating place but overcrowded.  We went on a very hot day and completed the tour in 90 minutes due to having to queue to get into some features.	2019-06	3	3	0
516	516	Beautiful Open Air Park	We had the opportunity to visit this open air museum on a recent trip to Turkey.The setting is stunning and the cave churches are amazing.  Inside each of the churches are frescoes depicting the teachings that the churches were used for.A great stop!	2019-05	5	3	1
517	517	Goreme National Park is brilliant.	"Discovering Goreme National Park was amazing. Various tours take in some of the main sites and viewpoints. However if you like hiking and clambering over landscapes this is an absolute must. There are numerous valleys to explore. Lots of great threads and information on here which we used on a daily basis. Views are breathtaking and I lost count how many times we  simultaneously said ""Wow!"". The popular tours and the valley walks are fairly easy going and trainers are sufficient but if you fancy going a little 'off piste"" it can be hard work especially considering the heat. For this I would recommend hiking shoes/boots or trainers with very good soles as you need traction on some steep declines."	2019-06	5	3	1
518	518	Another attraction	Another must see. Nice to see the church caves with drawings of the saints still preserved. Again be sure to bring umbrella, sunblock and water.	2019-06	5	3	1
519	519	Forgiveness of nature.	Forgiveness of nature to the industrious people who appreciate it. Pass Natural history course so much funney.	2019-06	5	3	1
520	520	Top Attraction	We spent our holidays in Side and had the opportunity to fly to Kayseri (one our flight from Antalya) and visit  Goreme National Park in Cappadocia. A must see attraction, located in the heart of Turkey, with unsual rock formations, valley, canyon as a resul of the eroding rains and winds of thousand years. Undrground cities, mushroom shaped formations, amazing natural wonders and fascinating history.	2019-05	5	3	1
521	521	Nice experencing how cave men stayed and dined etc but overrates specially steeply priced	I went here with my family. Most museums including this one in Turkey are over prices and so not worth it. Otherwise it is a nice and different experience where you get to picture how little ancient men lived, slept, dined, cooked in caves	2019-05	3	3	1
522	522	Quite overwhelming	Full of churches in caves. Dont miss the amazing one half way down the hill on the right on the way back to the car park. They dont let you take pictures of the best church cave paintings which is a shame. There is a cafe at the top. A fair amount of steps. I was irritated to pay my entrance fee and then expected to pay more to go in one of the sites. You cant get to see two of the main rock areas which I think I recall being the monestry and nunnery areas. Interesting place though and well worth seeing. Expect it to be swamped with tourists.	2019-05	4	3	0
523	523	Overrated	Im talking only about museum part closed with the fence. This place is overrated, stones, tiny caves and hot sun! That is all what youll get there. The entrance fee is ridiculously high for such a boring place! (45 lira). Funny thing -that the same stones and caves you may see for free around this “museum territory”	2019-06	2	3	1
524	524	A Comic Book World	AComing here is a like to a world of fantasy . All you have thought of a fairyland seems to be taking shape on ground. Well laid out over a large area strewn by rocky shapes and sizes which denies all structural imagination only to look awe inspiring.  Agog with tourists ,all the time of the year has an excellent township of Goreme which in itself is beautiful with affordable restaurant and shops of local artefacts and souvenirs . Mind boggling structures looks so beautiful from shapes so weird and incredulous that can only look so imaginative and attractive . A must see and icing in the cake for Cappadocia.	2019-05	4	3	1

527	527	Wonderful	Everything in Göreme is beautiful!! I really enjoyed every landscape!I believe people must be more careful with trash in a place like that, because I saw several plastics, paper thrown away in the ground!	2019-05	5	3	0
528	528	Unique & fascinating	This is a must-see place in Turkey. It has lots and lots of strange rock formation. Many came here to ride hot air balloon.	2019-04	4	3	1
529	529	One of so many amazing places	Cappadocia Turkey is an amazing valley of fairy chimneys and homes and churches carved into the rock.  Goreme has amazing churches on various levels of the rock, many with lovely murals and paintings.  Be sure to allow time to visit as you do need to climb up and down to see everything, but it is so worthwhile to do so.	2019-04	5	3	1
530	530	Day 1 of 3	Gerome National Park is a must for all when visiting this area. Scenery is awesome and theres so much too see.   The paths are well laid out, needless to say to be a bit careful. Amazing place.	2019-05	4	3	1
531	531	Unique Geology	The geology of this region has to be seen to be believed.  It is just wonderful.  If I got a dollar for every time I said Wow I’d be a millionaire.  Pictures don’t do it justice, walking amongst the rock formations and flying over on a ballon gave me a real appreciation of the uniqueness of this region.	2019-05	4	3	1
532	532	Remarkable	You came here to see a place like no other , interesting , unique , intriguing , one that will remain in your memory for sure as it is all that and more . Enjoyed every minute of it and surely you will too .	2019-05	5	3	1
533	533	great to see how they lived	its a cool insight to the lifestyle that wasn't so long ago for the people that live in cappadocia. You can appreciate the raw living situation and great lengths they went to put a rood over their heads.	2019-05	5	3	1
534	534	Wonderful place to visit	A must see place when in kappadocya.The views there and experience are breath taking, you will see history dating thousands of years.Bring a good camera, you will be using it a lot.	2019-05	5	3	1

537	537	North and East Turkey	A wonderfully exciting customised tour with StreamCo Tours again. We have travelled much of Turkey now but Fatih always finds somewhere interesting and different for us to experience. Lovely Boutique Hotels, excellent food and comfortable travel...what more could you ask for. Without question we will return to experience the wonders of this incredible country. Thankyou Fatih, you are an excellent guide and now yours and our friendship has been extended to our son Graham who so enjoyed everything. Until next time......	2019-04	5	3	1
538	538	Nicely maintained but most of the murals are not in a good condition	Goreme Open Air Museum, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, contains the finest rock-cut earliest churches in history. Within some churches are beautiful frescoes. Unfortunately, many of them are in poor condition and one can barely make out what they depict. The structures have weathered well. The living quarters, churches, and other areas are relatively fine and most are open to visitors.	2019-04	4	3	0
539	539	Other Planet! ,)	Fascinated!Fascinateddddd!Did I mentioned that I am fascionated?!! I am 52 and I was never on other Planet. Till this May ,)MUST SEE in life! That is it. Must. I even must go again, baloooms did not fly :((So, just walk, ride a horse, car, whstever, but see the most you can!Everything is for photo. I made so many wonderful photos and much more memories, ofc. I like people also. Very gentle, not pushy, I am surprised more than I expected to be	2019-05	5	3	0
540	540	Excellent	Very nice and interesting place to visit. There is a very interesting story about that place, so you should read about it before visiting, or take a guide there. I would recommend to do it as a walking tour. If you use taxy you will probably miss a bunch of things. I was there at the beginning of May and the temperature was ~30°C.	2019-05	5	3	1
541	541	Another Planet	When you visit Turkey, Cappadocia is an absolute must. At first site you will think you are on another planet. Though the region has developed a lot over the past 10 years in regard to hotels, restaurants, you are in a World Unesco Heritage Site and National Park which is highly protected. The village of Goreme itself is, in my opinion,.the most charming of the five villages in the province though you cannot really count Nevsehir as it is actually the capital city of the province and not village like at all. Goreme has the highest number of Fairy Chimneys  and churches in the region so I highly recommend that you make your Cappadocia base in Goreme. There are numerous restaurants where you can feast upon absolutely yummy traditional Turkish food, but I would wander up into the old side of the village and simply ask where yo ucan find the restaurant where 'Top Deck' is the chef. He and his wife create excellent dishes you will never forget! Your days can be filed with hot air ballooning (very worthwhile - recommend Cappadokya Balloons), go horseback riding, take a 4 wheeler, absolutely visit the underground cities (at least one of them), the hot springs or just enjoy walking through the valleys. This is a photographers paradise with sunsets and sunrises not to be matched. Though many of the farmers have moved away they are still to be found just outside the village and have many a story to be told. You can always travel to the easide but do not miss Goreme, National Park!	2018-06	5	3	1
542	542	Cappadocia's highlight!	Goreme National Park is the star attraction of Cappadocia.  The various frescos inside the churches, combined with the breathtaking landscapes, are amazing.  Allow at least 1.5 hours due to lines that must be endured to enter the chapels.  Enjoy!	2019-04	4	3	1
543	543	Fabulous place	A must see for all travellers.. Jaw dropping landscapes and amazing scenery.. Hike around the valleys, e.g. Pigeon Valley and enjoy Turkish tea amidst the red terrain..Just do it..	2019-05	5	3	1
544	544	As with most of the sites in this area, just amazing.	"We went here as part of a ""red"" tour and were captivated with the sights like all the other crowds....  you need to expect the crowds as its such an iconic sight. The frescos in the churches are steeped in history and well worth seeing.Unless your very early or late in the afternoon your unlikely to avoid the crowds but I still feel it's well worth the visit."	2019-05	5	3	0
545	545	Amazing Panoramic View	A must for Red tour& Green Tour are all day activities including lunch. You will see all attractive place of Goreme. and Balloon riding is a must as well.	2019-04	5	3	0
546	546	Open air spoilt by the large tourist groups.	Head there first thing in the morning or after 4pm. Even better, head out for hikes to red and rose valley to see frescos without the maddening, camera click happy crowds and listen to the birds. Divine.	2019-04	5	3	1
547	547	Beautiful valleys and rock formations	We hiked around the various valleys covering about 16 miles on total. The are a whole bunch of valleys to choose from, red, rose, white aka love valley, pidgeon and probably many more that we didn't see.Is is worth doing some of the view points and also spending sometime in the valleys for close ups.Do a little research before you come to decide what you want to see.There are also red, blue a green tours which take in particular sites, but doing it that way you have to go at the guides speed and rarely get closer than a view point.	2019-05	5	3	0
548	548	Worth seeing but not the best	The park is definitely beautiful but there are other equally beautiful places in Göreme. Check it out if you have time - we did it as part of the red tour package.Try and avoid tour bus crowds by going early am. Better photo opportunities elsewhere	2019-05	4	3	1
549	549	Amazing natural park	A magnificent park with the very strange rocky structures not found in any part of the world. The rocks are very complex with 3 levels formed over thousands of years	2019-04	5	3	1
550	550	Great view	Even without the balloons it has a great view. Since the weather was so bad we couldnt fly with the balloons we had much time to visit a lot of places. Goreme National Park it's beautiful and when you have a smart tour guard you can learn a lot about history	2019-05	5	3	1
551	551	Also Known as Goreme Open Air Museum	We came here as part of the Red Tour for 28 euros per person.  Our tour included the entrance fee of 45 tl.  Prepare to spend 1-2 hours here.We came late morning and it was already very crowded which made the experience not as enjoyable.  To view many of the rooms, prepare to line up.  And once you are inside, you are expected to keep moving with some rooms not allowed for photography.It is an interesting area but not the most interesting during our visit in Cappadocia.	2019-04	4	3	1
552	552	wonderland	we visited this site on a day tour. it's truly amazing and exquisite. a real travel back in time, a fantastic experience.	2019-04	5	3	1
553	553	Otherworldly landscape	Instamatic opportunities all around! It’s so interesting seeing these places that were carved out for dwellings hundreds of years ago.	2019-04	5	3	1
554	554	Its nice but gets repetitive	This is a must see as the history is great but i think there are 2-3 caves which are amazing and the paintings are unbelievable but after them they all look pretty much the same...empty caves with black roofs from the cooking. It gets very busy with bus loads of people and school trips so get there early or go between 1-2 as thats when the buses have lunch. It has beautiful views but 1 hour 30 mins is more then enough to spend here	2019-04	4	3	0
555	555	Stunning frescos but badly run	There are several cave churches to visit in this open air museum complex, one or two of which are simply stunning.However, the museum is incredibly busy with masses of school and tourist groups meaning you have to queue for every church - and some have an attendant inside barking at you to keep shuffling along meaning you can’t really stop and look at anything properly.I guess if you get there when the doors open it might be a better experience, but if you’re on an organised tour, this won’t happen. All photography is prohibited in the caves, meaning you can’t even take home your memories of those beautiful frescos. This seems excessive as stopping flash photography only should be sufficient.	2019-04	3	3	0
556	556	Wander	Life is beautiful when one wanders and gazes at the simple details that make everything look spectacular and unique.	2019-04	5	3	1
557	557	must go	amazing indeed lots of pictures shooting not much walk  but many unique sites worth to take interesting pictire	2019-03	5	3	1
558	558	Worth the visit	I spent about 2 hours visitin there, it's beautiful and has amazing views. Def recommend ! I visted with the Green Tour.	2019-03	5	3	1
559	559	A must see	If you visit Cappadocia, you must see Goreme Open Museum. It is the most comprehensive site. But crowded with tourists.	2019-04	5	3	1
560	560	Enduring Faith	When you visit the Gerome open air museum you will be moved by the faith of these early Christians. With more than a dozen chapels carved into the rock formations and rich (but now defaced) paintings it is easy to imagine the faithful flocking to this place for pilgrimage. The rock formations are fascinating. It is little difficult to see all the chapels but if you can manage the steep climbs , it is worth it. The place is well maintained with good signage	2019-04	5	3	1
561	561	Interesting	Take a walk to the park and walk up close to some stones. Make sure the weather is nice and sunny. It is on the way to the open air museum.	2019-04	4	3	1
562	562	Must visit	There are so many atttactions in capaddocia region and i can easily put this place in my top 3. Definetly visit if you are in the area.	2019-04	5	3	1
563	563	Interesting and Unusual	Interesting and informative place understand the development of Cappadocia.  Do not miss the different churches dug into the caves that were later decorated with Byzantine paintings.  It was interesting to see how the cave diggers mimicked the decorative patterns and architectural features of the Byzantine Churches.	2019-04	5	3	0
564	564	Fascinating place	Part of Red  tour. It's amazing place to learn history. Fascinating place to visit. Very photogenic. Apple Church was culmination for me as frescos were just stunning . Can't take pictures inside Chapels and Churches ... but surroundings are just amazing . Wear comfortable shoes, lots climbing , high steps, bit tight on the staircases - but it's stunning .	2019-04	5	3	1
565	565	Number 1 in Turkey	This area is so beautiful and different. Take 2 or 3 days to explore the different valleys, and you will not regret it!	2019-04	5	3	1
566	566	One of highlights of the visit to Cappadocia	Goreme open air museum, which consists of  ruins of number of monasteries, churches and houses carved into volcanic rock mountains. It is now UNESCO World Heritage site. Wear comfortable shoes for the visit, is you will have to both walking and some climbing. Some of the churches have frescoes which are worth seeing.	2019-04	5	3	1
567	567	So busy!	If you’ve got your own wheels or are in Gorëme, come yourself early morning or late afternoon. The part the tour companies take you to was super crowded. Amazing, amazing place though.	2019-04	4	3	1
568	568	Fairyland!	This is large open air experience where you walk through an ancient valley of cave dwellings and churches. Guides are available but the site is well signposted. There are several small eateries offering a range of local food. Excellent for a half day tour.	2019-04	5	3	1
569	569	Wonderful Place to Visit	Such unique and wonderful national park to visit. Had to see it at least once in your life time. You can rent a car or joint a tour group. Nice local people as well.	2019-04	5	3	1
570	570	NICE BUT BUSY	With hindsight, we should have gone earlier but we were jaded after our balloon trip. A nice museum but it's absolutely heaving (even at 1000 am) with large groups of tourists. The churches are - unsurprisingly - small so it can get a bit frustrating to get around. Dark Church was closed but the frescoes in the other churches, including Sandal Church, were amazing given that they're over 1000 years old. Signposting could be improved. Don't miss Buckle Church which is down the hill about 100m	2019-04	4	3	0
571	571	So much to see and do!	An amazing place not like anywhere else I have seen. Loads to see and do (and eat!) from ballooning to organised tours and horse riding. But just the hiking alone is spectacular enough.	2019-04	5	3	0
572	572	A dream called Goreme	It is a place where history and spirituality show us in a wonderful way how people have lived centuries before in harmony with nature and God	2019-04	5	3	1
573	573	Stunning place	Given that the whole area is due to volcanic activity millenia ago it is fascinating to see the shapes that the weather and temperatures have created.	2019-04	5	3	0
574	574	Very interesting place this.	Open air museum is an interesting title to draw you in. Shows a lot of the history of the area and how much of their life was based around religion (Christian, banned at the time) and the lengths they would go to, to hide it. I haven’t given it 5 stars as I just feel there is more that can be done to enhance the visitor’s experience. Felt a bit restricted in options.	2019-04	4	3	1
575	575	Amazing scenery	Goreme national part was an amazing place to visit and is a must see for anyone that enjoys the natural world. The only other place that I have visited where I felt I was on another planet was Bryce Canyon I rented a car and drove around capaddocia and I would definitely recommend.	2019-04	5	3	1

577	577	Green and Red tour conducted by ATV	Booked 2 day trips conducted by the same company through my hotel, Carvanserai Hotel. Lucky enough to be conducted by same tour guide Mr Cemil Demircan. He was very professional and very informative on the places visited. With his experience, the group was very well organised and managed to always get to the various places of interest before most of the bus loads of tourists. He had made the trips interesting and with little time wasted on queues. Highly recommended tours conducted by the ATV!	2019-04	5	3	0
578	578	a must to visit	a unique place , it is very nice to wonder around and watch the amazing caves built in huge rocks and know the history of it A guide will be very helpful .	2019-02	5	3	1
579	579	Stunning and unique	Fabulous - not beautiful, maybe a little too otherworldly for that.  Amazing scenery and views - a little like being on Mars or another planet.	2019-03	5	3	1
580	580	Awesome place	Nice place. If u r staying in Goreme about 20 mins walking distance because public buses is an hour scheculed. Entrance fee is 45 TL. And it till take about 1-1,5 hour to take tour. Nice place with full of history	2019-03	5	3	1
581	581	Nice	Beautiful to seeThe old church and the way the old people use to live. Winery and things like that. Loved it	2019-03	4	3	1
582	582	Good visit !	If you’re going alone and not as part of a guided tour, do invest 15TL on the audio guide. This one is really good and worth the money adding lot of perspective to the architecture you see.An important thing to note is that the entrance fee is cash only. We were lucky that we had some cash to cover for it since we always prefer to pay by card at such places!	2019-03	5	3	0
583	583	Wander around	A great place to wander around and look at all of these wonderful natural rock formations.  We were able to go inside one of them and see how people live.	2019-03	4	3	1
584	584	Definitely worth a visit!	It is well-deserved as a top destination. It is a manageable size, so can walk around to see whatever interests you.	2019-03	5	3	1
585	585	Very nice experience	We went there last week and it was snowing, the scenery was mesmerizing and it is very rich in culture and historical sights.	2019-02	5	3	0
586	586	Breathtaking and totally unique landscape	It an amazing heritage, beautiful landscape and so unique place to visit. Every cave is a masterpiece of the nature that you should see for sure.	2019-02	5	3	1
587	587	Must be	We have forty national and over three hundred nature park but Göreme is very different&unique maybe not in Anatolia but also in the world with fairy chimneys, churches, under ground cities, hot baloon activity, Sema, Turkish Nights, making pottery shows and very delicios wines and countless dreams...	2019-02	5	3	1
588	588	Reasons to visit Cappadocia	The Goreme museum is something out of this world. It is unbelievable to see how people lived in those stone structures. Not too much to walk and the heat is not as big a factor. They actually look better from outside than inside but do visit inside to see how people lived. Carry an umbrella during summer and a coat in winter... Weather can be a bit extreme...	2018-08	4	3	1
589	589	No need to pay for  open air museum	Gerome in itself is an open air museum , you need not to pay for it ...go anywhere in gerome and you will enjoy ... go nearby places for sunrise or sunset	2018-10	4	3	0
590	590	I want to visit	I'm thinking of visiting here. I found positive comments and good feedback that it is such a nice place. Turkey really is a beautiful country	2018-08	5	3	1
591	591	Worth the trip	Very interesting area and great access. Can be busy, so morning might be the best option. Well maintained and easy walking. Parking is limited close by.	2018-10	5	3	1
592	592	The Open Air Museum is fascinating.	I've done the Open Air Museum twice....once with a guide and once with the audio.  Both were very interesting and have their advantages. The guide can be a good storyteller and give 'extra' information, while the audio is very factual.  It's almost worth doing both together!  Definitely pay the extra 10 lira to see the Dark Church.  The paintings in there are the best ones at the Museum.	2018-10	4	3	1
593	593	Must See!!	Goreme is also know center of Cappadoccia, it host some of the most beautiful and significant historic places for the Christianity (where the first Christian settle after running away from the Romans) really amazing place.	2018-11	5	3	1
594	594	Stunning Vistas, Lots of Culture & History	Must visit! Stunning vistas with interesting rock formations. Lots of history and culture. Enjoyed the frescoes.	2019-01	5	3	1
595	595	Like a fairy tale	We visited this places back in August, the weather was not too hot as we were expecting in Cappadocia, so it was very comfortable visiting all these open places.If you have the chance visit the place early morning as soon as it opens because then is extremely way too crowded and is difficult to enter to the churches inside the caves, or there is a line to enter die to the huuuuge groups they arrive around 12:00 pm.The place is amazing but if you dont like crowded places just come very early in the morning to avoid all the mass of tourists.	2018-08	5	3	1
596	596	Beautiful open air museum	Its huge place, having beautiful view, rich on history as well. However there are many places that is not allowed for photography. Recommended to go with tour guide since you will get an explanation about the history.	2018-02	5	3	1
597	597	Very interesting.	Rock formations in the area, I think it is worthy the ride.One of many touristics spots  in Cappadocia.	2018-09	4	3	1
598	598	amazing landscape	The landscape is amazing. Absolute nice to make a small walk. Good for photografing. one of the most beautiful areas on earth.	2018-06	5	3	1
599	599	Stunning Winter views	The area is covered in snow and the views are stunning. Peaceful and enjoyable with less crowds to enjoy all the scenery and history. Everyone is warm and friendly and willing to chat over a cup of tea.	2019-01	5	3	1
600	600	Local Guide to Goreme and Dervish Dances Info	Incredible place for hiking and sightseeing. Best if combined with the underground city in Kaymakli and Dervish ceremony. We hired a local, certified guide Zafer Hoca. He is retired English teacher, very knowlageble and nice.His number is 05367260968. He directed us to the Dervis Evi, a small place of worship Southeast exit from Goreme for the authentic performance (not a restaurant). Euro 10 pp. Starts at 6 pm, after the ceremony they dance for a while and let you take pictures. Tel. 90 384 343 20 80, 90 532 486 32 54.	2019-01	5	3	0

602	602	Special place	It is the place I wanted to see from some time.It was like in my expectation:strange shapes of rocks turns into places to live. I admired once again the skills of ancient people to find solutions for survive in very difficult circumstances and climatic conditions.And I appreciated the well preserved area of GoremeNational Park.	2018-11	5	3	1

604	604	Must to see when in Cappadocia.	We were amazed to see rock cut churches and how it must be colonised in old times. Well worth of 45 lira spent as admission fees and 2-3 hours of time.Facility management should work there a bit more in snowy conditions as people were slipping due to hardened snow. There were no pavements or salt sprayed on roads to make safe walking around.	2018-12	4	3	0
605	605	Amazing Rock Formation	The Open Air Museum is walking distance from Goreme downtown. As of writing January 2019, ticket price at 45TL. Opens at around 8am. 1-2 hours is enough to see the place. The place is nice to see in winter and have a different view of these rock formation. A must see in Cappadocia.	2019-01	5	3	1
606	606	A must visit when in Cappadocia	We did horse riding through the national park and just loved it. The park is a must visit for the amazing landscape and horizons. The best views and sights of Cappadocia are all within the park	2018-12	5	3	1
607	607	Marvelous!!	Just marvelous!! Seeing creations like these reminds you of our Great Creator and His marvelous creations!!A must see!!	2019-01	5	3	1
608	608	Amazing	If you manage to get to this part of the world goreme open air museum is something that should not be missed the 45lirs entrance fee is great value, also one in you should pay the extra 15lira entrance fee into the dark church, the 12 century frescos are amazing and look as if they were painted yesterday	2019-01	5	3	0
609	609	Nice place to visit - long crowd at the ticket selling point	The place is obviously nice but the queue for the tickets are very long and the guides are consistently breaking the queue to buy large numbers of tickets.	2018-12	3	3	1
610	610	Reviews	We were on the tour of the day.   This was a Very memorable tour to see abd experience such rich history and learn so much of the place and its importance.  A must visit for all	2018-12	5	3	1
611	611	Another Turkish Surprise	Something new around every corner. You are going to love Turkey! The Goreme National Park was delightful. It was so fun to wander around the go in and out of this little piece of history. Amazingly well preserved and fun to imagine what life might have been like living there. We all loved the experience here. We came with an escorted tour group, but I'm so glad they chose this stop. After talking to others, we wish we had paid extra to see the church.	2018-12	5	3	1
612	612	I was expecting to see better paintings..	It was covered with snow, lovely look from the outside but this place is know for its monastery and the drawings and history, we have a good guide that tells the story well, but the drawings on the wall... it’s disappointing. Also, saying this might be a little weird, I was astonished by the effort that that people put in for the sake of vandalising the “snake” church drawings. I mean it’s 3-4m above ground and they decided to climb to leave their name there... Honestly I was pretty angry at these nuts, whoever they are/ were.	2018-12	2	3	0
613	613	Stunning frescos	We had a superb morning here, although it was crowded. However the highlights were the ceilings in the church for which you have to pay a small additional fee. They are well worth it.	2018-09	5	3	0
614	614	Cappadokya	The Goreme National Park is a UNESCO world heritage site.   The park is surrounded by stunning little towns with top class accommodation,  restaurants and activities. The park is a large area made up of canyons and valleys with old cave houses and churches scattered all over the place.Long, medium or short walks.  Easy, medium or difficult terrain with panoramic view points everywhere. A masterclass of nature with fresh air and friendly locals.  Cappadokya is a special place made all the more pleasant by warm Turkish hospitality.My second visit to the area.  Last time in summer, this time in winter.  Both truly eye opening.  A genuine source of inspiration. An easy 1 hour plane trip from Istanbul.  A walkers paradise with literally tons of stuff to do.	2018-12	5	3	1
615	615	History to be seen	It's all a wonder, well worth going to see. This is on one of the tours we took and it was nice to be able to walk at our own pace and look at everything as long as we needed to.	2018-11	5	3	1
616	616	worth visiting	some historical churches within the volcanic rocks. you can see some paintings inside the churches but mostly are damaged.	2018-12	4	3	0
617	617	A must see	A must see in Goreme. The park is well preserved and well maintained. I am sure you will click some amazing photos there.	2018-07	5	3	1
618	618	Mjeh	I do see the error of my ways - with out previous research a rather unimpressive place. So I would highly concider hiring a guide, there are plenty of them already there and one even approached us. Being Estonian I don't like people talking to me, so we said no. Kinda regret it. Caves are interesting, but after seeing one you've kinda seen them all, at least when you know nothing about them. So solo 5/10. With a guide? Well he did promise a 100% satisfaction guarantee...	2018-12	3	3	1
619	619	historical site, unique landscape	place where Christianity proliferated in times of great persecution. Wonderful place, with many man-made caves for shelter and hiding place.	2018-06	5	3	1
620	620	Be Careful of Camel Service In Front of the Museum	After exiting Goreme National Park, my sister and I were attracted with cute camels sitting in front of the parking lots. We asked for a price casually. The guys there who we talked to inform two options of camel experience: to go for one round camel ride and to take a picture stand still with a camel. We did not even decide, discussing what option we wanted. All of the sudden, the guys approached me from the back and lifted me up without my permission, putting me on top of the camel (I was wearing a super short skirt and everyone can see my panties inside). I was screaming. Another guy lifted my sister up to another camel right beside me. The guys pulled camels for a walk. They asked for my phone to take pictures for 2 mins. It was very forceful and we both had to end up paying money for both ride and picture. THIS IS A SCAM. And it left us with a horrifying feeling after visiting Goreme museum. I wish this service is being taken down because not only it scams tourist on a regular basis, the camels there are very old, unhappy, aggressive and treated poorly. This service gives me the wrong impression of Turkish people and I think the government should take time and examine this because the service is right in front of the national museum and innumerably levies so many people.	2018-08	1	3	0
621	621	Wonderfull Place,	Most probably there is no other place as interesting as Capadoccia. It was in winter when I visit and we have chance to see this place fully white under snow.	2018-01	5	3	1
622	622	Very Scenic and Unique Open Air Museum	This is a very scenic and beautiful place.  We enjoyed the great views and have a good time exploring the caves.  Picture perfect place.	2018-12	5	3	1
623	623	Unique open-air museum	This place feels pretty unique. The rock formations are beautiful and the churches are interesting too. It is quite big and you can easily spend hours there just wandering around and enjoying the atmosphere.	2018-10	5	3	1
624	624	Unique	Unique landscape, not to be missed. Paved paths lead to entry to churches cut into the rocks, and great overlooks for photographs.	2018-11	5	3	0
625	625	Unique	Hard to pick a favorite here, I expected to be bored of seeing stones after the first valleys but it was not the case, each canyon had a different feeling and deeply enjoyed the area. A very unique and special area.	2018-11	5	3	1
626	626	So much history...	THis place is just fantastic. Love the tuffas and the amazing stories of past communities. If you love story go there...spend time in silence inside those caves and it is almost like you can see it....	2018-11	5	3	1
627	627	Don’t miss	Everything in Cappadoccia is surreal and memorable, but Goreme is really the best place to stay and the National Park is absolutely breathtaking. Can’t wait to go back	2018-03	5	3	1
628	628	Beautiful but hot!	We went in July and it was stunning, but brace yourself cause it was hot. There are however several spots you can go to to get a drink or snack if you need. Lol You can get some epic shots at this spot too. You can also visit the Dark Church that is there, although, personally I felt that it was a bit overrated. It’s a really small space, and there’s are guards there including in each of the other caves keeping a watchful eye on photographers. They don’t want you to take pictures, cause that might ruin the frescos....however, you can sneak a pic or two if they are nice. Lol	2018-07	5	3	1
629	629	Unforgettable place	Beautiful park where you can have a good idea about how this place was few years ago. Don’t waste the opportunity.	2018-09	4	3	1
630	630	Peaceful and beautiful	Goreme National Park is a must see for those traveling to this area.  My 10-year old son and I took a “Green Route” tour through some of the areas of the park which included a short 5k hike down the river valley.  It was autumn and the leaves were green and gold which made for great views in the river valley and a relaxing walk along the trail.  In the areas of the park which are away from the river you’ll find great phot opportunities as the sun illuminates the rock formations and the desert landscape.	2018-11	4	3	1
631	631	Magic	I had no idea this natural formation were so spread and numerous. It is truly impressive and our guide Ahmed made our tour magical!	2018-10	5	3	1
632	632	Lovely Christian History at Goreme National Park	Wonderful place to visit. Takes you back 2000 years. Interesting to see how early Christians stayed and spread their religion. Excellent frescos. If you are in Goreme., this is a must visit place	2018-10	4	3	1
633	633	Absolutely amazing place	If you only go to one place in Cappadocia then this would be the place to go.A wonderful and interesting place easy to walk around, though with little shade if you were visiting in the middle of summer.A lot to see in a small area.	2018-10	5	3	1
634	634	Unbelievable!	The rock formations are not like any other that I have seen.  And to think that Christians carved out housing and underground tunnel to escape the Romans is remarkable.	2018-10	5	3	1
635	635	Lovely Open Museum	Location is nice to visit, you will see a lot of variations in small area!! Nice experience.I will advise to read about this area and how it was established long time ago, this will help you in understanding why homes, churches, rooms were built in that way, and why too close to each other.	2018-06	5	3	1
636	636	Sometimes called Goreme Open Air Museum	Cappadocia is filled with delightful dwellings and 'churches' that are thousands of years old, each more fascinating than the next. This is one of the best. I'd highly suggest you use a local guide so you know where you are, where you''re going and what you're seeing. The whole Cappadocia area (which I believe is approximately 60 square miles) is worth exploring both by foot and car. An early-morning balloon is considered a must by many tourists, but we didn't do this and don't feel we missed out on experiencing the many marvels here. You can't see everything in a couple of days, but whatever you do see - even in a 1-day visit - will remain with you forever. The place is magical.	2018-10	5	3	1
637	637	Awesome scenery with fascinating history	The whole area is full of fascinating sites and history. The area attracts a lot of visitors but there is space for everyone and loads of activities from walking to hot air ballooning. Great for kids and adults alike. Must visit if in the area.	2018-11	5	3	1
638	638	Beautiful	There are many interesting hikes through this fascinating landscape and a lot of history and relics as well.	2018-10	5	3	1
639	639	WOW!!	Really amazing! We appreciated our tour guide, who really knew the park. A must do if you are in Goreme!	2018-09	5	3	1
640	640	A must do once in Goreme	It is a must do for tourists because it is popular for its chimneys and most photographed areas. It is good place with lots of tourists making noise and poses,) we had a nice time and nice pictures.	2018-10	5	3	1
641	641	interesting monastic christian cities carved into stone	During my late September visit the place was fairly crowded with Chinese tourists scrambling all over the place. The painted frescoes in the rock churches were not that detailed and no photography was allowed with or without flash. It was interesting to see on the ground what we'd seen the day before from a hot air balloon.  Worth the visit	2018-09	4	3	1
642	642	Natural wonder tour	This is a unique open air museum that will take you on a magical trip  with fairy chimneys, ancient caves,  pigeon houses and natural volcanic rock formations.Walking down steps that offer close views of the vivid shapes of rocks that have been formed over centuries will soothe your eyes.	2018-10	5	3	1
643	643	First stop in Goreme	This was an amazing experience, a unique landscape and rich history unlike anywhere else in the world.	2018-09	5	3	1
644	644	don't miss this experience, just go for it	This was an unreal experience, great for kids of all ages as well, it's a must do in Goreme.If you ever go to Goreme, be sure not to miss this	2018-10	5	3	0
645	645	Stupendous	Step back in time and imagine what it may have been like, living a spiritual life in these carved out fairy chimneys. The frescoes are fascinating. This area is like no other place on earth. You may not think you are. Do a hot air ballon ride...trust me, you will never regret it!	2018-10	5	3	1
646	646	Natural beauty unfolds	The Goreme National park is a place of surprising natural beauty that is enhanced by human adaptation. The area is marked for easy roaming around but we opted for a guide which helped a lot in explaining the area.	2018-07	5	3	1
647	647	A nice discovery	We did enjoy discovering Goreme National Park, which os in act in the open air. The kids loved going into the caves and wanted to spend the whole day vosting.	2018-08	5	3	1
648	648	Worth seeing but a guide might be worthwhile	We walked to the open air museum and bought the audio guide rather than going as a tour. There is not a lot of signage around telling you what you're seeing inside the caves. The audio tour was cheap but not worth it. It was worth the trip to see but looking into a tour might be worthwhile as you're likely to get more information that would make the experience better	2018-10	3	3	1
649	649	Amazing History	Had a great time viewing the churches in the Goreme national park. All are interesting.  some are well preserved and others have been renovated.  Worth paying the extra to see the dark church which has some of the best paintings. The caves with tables and cooking pits are also interesting.	2018-07	4	3	1
650	650	Amazing fairy chimneys and rock formations	Had a wonderful time at the Goreme National Park in Turkey, and was mesmerised by the awe inspiring rock formations.A complete one day visit to this great national park, with different observation points in the Pigeon Valley, Urchisar Castle , with a Jeep Safari and a Hot Air Balloon ride created a lasting memory of this beautiful Cappadocia region in Turkey.The famous fairy chimney land is created after a volcanic eruption, and the rock formations were formed by the forces of nature through the erosion by the wind and rain condition. A ride by hot air balloon into the air to see the vast area from the sky is an exceptional experience.Our jeep safari brought us into the Rose Valley and we could see more of the unique  rock formations in this area.A visit to the Kaymakli Underground City showcased the life and living conditions in the subterranean chamber of the people with the construction of cellars, church, and kitchen in those tunnels. This is the main highlight of anyone's visit to Turkey. To save time, it would be great to fly to the Cappadocia region with two airports nearby. They are Kayseri and Nevsehir Airport.	2018-10	5	3	1
651	651	Unbelievable!	This whole place, the whole region is unbelievable. It is so so so mesmerizing. Feels like I have been transported into another world.	2018-10	5	3	0
652	652	Great history	It is great seeing the old, carved in stone houses, nice landscapes. Perfect place to forget about the city noises.	2018-09	5	3	1
653	653	Its worth a visit	We had done pigeon valley & love valley in the morning and we we're quite tired so at first this seemed extra, but we went since our hotel staff suggested it so strongly. We meandered around the open air museum and were amazed at the state of the some of the frescos, the place is very well kept & you should visit the UNESCO site.	2018-10	4	3	1
654	654	Best place to see how this earth was formed over the last million years through a common eye.	Loved every minute of my time and my next trip will be for 2 weeks driving a rented car and not public transport.	2018-01	5	3	1
655	655	Amazing landscapes	Cappadocia is an amazing place to visit. The landscape formations,underground homes, churches ,are all mind blowing.Great walks available through the valleys.	2018-09	5	3	1
656	656	UNESCO World Heritage Site! Beautiful!	This a beautiful area which has a lot of the cave dwellings in which the ancients used to live. Our guide showed us the areas where they used to cook their food and the refectory where they used to sit and eat together. He also showed us lot of churches in this region and we visited a lot of these churches with exotic names such as Apple Church, St. Barbara Church, Snake Church & Dark Church (Karanlık Kilise) where the frescoes are preserved beautifully as the church did not have any natural light - additional ticket of 10TL.I was impressed by how the monks used to live in ancient times and how well planned they were. Can easily spend 2 hours in this place exploring.	2018-09	4	3	1
657	657	Great	Very interesting , well worth a trip, we went on a private tour, our guide was friendly and very knowledgeable, and spoke excellent English	2018-10	5	3	1
658	658	They should learn some customer service	I was shocked after I paid & went to get an audio guide that I had to leave my passport.  I don't carry my passport on me and there is no way that I would leave it with them!  I offered money but the girl was very very rude and ended up ignoring me and started talking to the next person.  I haven't been treated like this anywhere!  I also couldn't believe that you had to pay to get into another church- crazy.  We were in and out within an hour and had no idea what we looked at!	2018-10	1	3	0
659	659	Amazing landscape and scenery	We were recommended to visit this area of Cappadocia as seeing was believing. The recommendation was spot on. You need to be here to appreciate the landscape in front of your eyes not just through pictures	2018-10	5	3	1
660	660	No need for a full day tour	I would advise people not to take a full-day tour of goreme national park it's better to take a panoramic sightseeing overview so that you can cover it as much as well as you will cover much of it through your hot air balloon ride so no need to spend 3 or 4 hours.	2018-09	3	3	1
661	661	Amazing!	Very beautiful natural landscape! It's quite an experience to visit this area! I'm very happy I did it!	2018-10	5	3	1
662	662	Very interesting	Don't miss, if you are in Goreme area, do not miss it! Pictures give a small idea of the real thing, live experience is a must do!	2018-09	5	3	0
663	663	Stunning landscapes	The most incredible rock formations unique to this region On our tour with reliable travel we saw 4 different valleys from above at stunning lookout points and among the rocks by small hiking trips. Quite spectacular	2018-10	5	3	1
664	664	Just go there and see for yourself.	There´s a reason this site is a UNESCO heritage site. Unbelievable landscape and manmade habitats inside the cliffs.	2018-04	5	3	1
665	665	Fascinating geology	This open air museum is worth a visit to experience the authentic cave structures of the area. It is dedicated to a Christian settlement of monks, priests and nuns who lived there around the 3rd century. There are about a dozen small churches and cave rooms, some with their original paintings which are now quite faded and in need of restoration. But restoration has begun and it will be more interesting in years to come. It cost 45 lire ( about £6 ) at the time of our visit . There is also an additional 15 lire to visit the dark church where the paintings are naturally brighter but we didn't opt for this. Or you can hire a headset for information at an extra 15 lire, but there are written explanations outside of every structure which we found sufficient. The site itself is very steep with slopes and steps so may not be suitable for those with mobility issues.There is a small coffee shop at the top of the site which is a very traditional Turkish style- not much seating if more than about half a dozen people are there.. Drinks here are expensive compared to outside the site and further down the road- 10 compared to 3 for the same drink! But you pay for the ambience ! Overall it's a very interesting place with several unique photo opportunities	2018-10	4	3	1
666	666	Great visit!	Wonderfully organised area to observe the cave dwellings and get a beautiful view of surrounding area!	2018-09	5	3	1
667	667	Dark church was by far the favorite	Self guided tour of cave dwelling like churches and homes.  Plan on about two hours to see everything.  Go counterclockwise once you enter the grounds.  Signs outside caves give brief narrative of what you will see in most places.	2018-09	4	3	1
668	668	history and nature merges	A lot of churches dates back to 7th century is located in this area. They were carved in chimneys. Great place to spend an afternoon. Make sure to have sunscreen, sun is very strong in this area.	2018-09	5	3	1
669	669	A great walk in this UNESCO site	Depend when you travel, it can get very hot and crowded. However, mornings are excellent. Good walking shoes will make the difference with bottled water at hand. Guides are plentiful - we did not use one but found excellent write ups on the internet which sufficed to help us in this place which is marked.	2018-09	5	3	1
670	670	Awesome historical UNESCO site	A great walk around gives you an incredible perspective of this UNESCO site. A pity that this touristy spot has a few restaurants which are super expensive but if you wander around, you will find a number of great gems, including the Organic Cave Kitchen	2018-09	4	3	1
671	671	Worth visiting	First of all I would recommend to visit this place early in the morning. This place is quite popular among the tourists and you can always see crowds of people there. If you travel by car the best choice is to come not on a weekend because tours come here at his time in big quantities. We came to Goreme as a part of our tour program but our guide was clever enough to avoid the crowd being the first visitors. In this way you get a chance to enjoy the ancient churches and take plenty of photos without a lot of other tourists around you.:) Besides the picturesque nature you will find here really wonderful examples of ancient frescs. Just imagine that they were founded 18 centuries ago and still haven't lost their power for believers. It's a special feeling. Even if you are not a religious person you will appreciate the historical meaning of this place.	2018-09	5	3	1
672	672	amazing	incredible unforgettable landscape and history. We also visited the Fairy Chimneys, Guludere Vadisi and the Camel Rock. The visit to the Carpet weaving Co-operative, and Ceramic factory and Museum were educational. The prehistoric and biblical relics on show at the Ceramic Cave  Museum were an eye-opening experience	2018-09	4	3	1
673	673	Stone's apartment	Its an amazing feeling to going into these apartments and visualised how folks living after christ. Plenty of mini churches with byzantium drawing. A must if you are going to Kapodakia.	2018-09	5	3	0
674	674	Great place to visit, BUT I'am not sure I would have liked to live there	During our recent trip to the Cappadocia region we spent a number of days on the ground and well as a wonderful Hot Air Balloon adventure. Seeing the Goreme National Park from the ground is amazing, seeing it from the basket of the hot air balloon is ASTONISHING, don't miss it.	2018-09	5	3	1
675	675	Must see	a very different landscape and very calm and serene surrounding. there is a bit of walking involved but its worth it.	2018-06	5	3	1
676	676	Amazing caves	Definitely a must-see of the Goreme National Park and how it was used as many smaller churches way back in history.	2018-09	5	3	1
677	677	Breathtaking - literally and view-wise	It was breathtaking especially if  you did the hot air balloon thing! Also, the history around this area was awesome. It gave you a little bit of history as to how Christianity flourished.	2018-08	5	3	1
678	678	Wonderful visit	Definitely a must see. Chapels and churches. Open caves to see how people lived 1000's of years ago. Incredibly interesting to learn the history. Fantastic spots for pictures	2018-09	4	3	1
679	679	What did I see?!	Wow, I mean I knew where I was heading to but, whatever waited there was absolutely out of any excpectation! The whole Cappadocia is extremely beautiful, unearthly really! Make sure to visit everything! The canyons, the underground city, the valleys, walk into caves, see the old temples, everything! And make sure to wake up early in the morning like at 5.00 am and head to any of the hill tops to sit and watch the amazing air balloons rising up together with the sun! P.s. and everything is extremely cheap!	2018-09	5	3	1
680	680	Unique sight	The Goreme National Park is a must see while in Capaddocia. The sights in Goreme are very different from the usual sights seen before in other countries. The rock formation is amazing and one of a kind. There is a tour of the rock chapels and formation either in the morning or afternoon and this can be combined with the hot air balloon experience. This is a must see sight.	2018-06	5	3	1
681	681	Must visit when in area	Stunning place. Unesco world heritage site. Fascinating history and unique caves. Really enjoyable day out and make sure to grab a local pomegranate juice!	2018-09	5	3	1
682	682	Walk and admire	Excellent place for an hike. Walk around and see the colors of the volcanic ashes pulled up to amazing rock formations. Make sure you bring enough water 💦 it’s hot and dusty. Batteries must be charged and don’t forget it’s possible to loose phone signal in that area. Enjoy 😉	2018-09	4	3	1
683	683	Magic	This place is a must see when coming to Cappadocia. It is exciting and beautiful. I would recommend you to take a guided tour.	2018-08	5	3	1
684	684	Beautiful	If you make it to the top after a long day of various tours, it's so beautiful,  Made it half way and very worth the tough climb above. Do it	2018-07	4	3	1
685	685	a Must See	Goreme is a small town where the 2000+ years of history is alive.  the day, the night, the views, all surreal.  a must see experience	2018-08	5	3	1
686	686	Very interesting	Very different and to think that people lived in these caves to avoid persecution and the history of the place was eye opening and certainly worth the visit	2018-06	5	3	0
687	687	Fairytale	We went there by car as we were staying in Goreme. Easily to reach and to park. The entrance costs 40 lira and there is also audio guide which is helpfull. Spend some time walking and admire the amazing churches with so old frescos inside. For another extra 10 lira you can visit Dark Church which worths for sure. The museum is outside so take water and maybe a hat or an umbrella. Read the helpful informations about every place there to find about beautiful things.	2018-08	5	3	1
688	688	Goreme National Park	This is a must for everyone, we were totally blown away with the beautiful views caves and history with this whole area. This is something I will remember the tour guide we had was from whoop whoop I know it sounds wrong, but it's right, was a great guy spoke in English and made it funny when explaining the history so you remembered most of it     this is a fabulous place to visit I hope this has been of some help to you all	2018-08	5	3	1
689	689	Beautiful	Don't miss the Park. To enjoy at it's best go later afternoon or early morning. Light is better and less people.	2018-08	5	3	1
690	690	Well worth a visit.	If you are planning on visiting cappadocia, you must visit go to Göreme National Park and open air museum	2018-08	5	3	1
691	691	Not that great if you are not a christian	This place is indeed unique & attracts a lot of tourists. But after the first one or two caves, it gets repetitive. But if you are a christian or are interested in christian paintings, you will love this place.	2018-08	3	3	1
692	692	great place	its so unique and great place you can see also a lot of church not in good condition and the old city	2018-08	5	3	1
693	693	National park Goreme	Fairy chimneys made by  rock formations, truely magical. Spent whole day looking wandering round the area visiting small local craft stalls as well.	2018-08	5	3	1
694	694	Worth visiting	We were take around this area by an excellent guide.Very special place.Highly recommended to see this and admire the beauty.	2018-08	5	3	1
695	695	Magical nature	This is one of the most amazing places I have ever been and every single place is wonderful there you can find carpet weaving and buy domestic handcrafts but the most wonderful thing is it’s nature the chimneys are odd and you can’t believe how they have been configured through ages	2018-08	4	3	1
696	696	Fantastic	We visited the place fir the first time. Its a magical place . Fantastic .lot of fairy chimneys.recommended . Would come again	2018-08	5	3	1
697	697	Don't miss it out	When you head to Goreme and start to wander around, you will quickly see that the place is magical. Whether you decide to go on the balloon, a horse, a quad, a bike or simply walk around you will enjoy being here. Get in the caves and explore a little, it is fantastic.	2018-07	4	3	1
698	698	If you can only visit one place in Cappadocia, this is it!	Beautiful open area filled with magical rock formations that have been carved into churches and dwelling back in the 11th century and earlier. Some of the churches still have original frescoes on the walls and ceiling. Many require going up stairs and covering the outdoor area requires walking. The views are stunning. There are also restaurants and snack places for food and water and some merchants selling trinkets and other items. There is a parking lot which tends to fill up but one can park on the road as well. There are other areas to view the rock formations, but this is the biggest and has the most ruins, so if you see this area you have a good sense of the landscape in Cappadocia. Don't miss it.	2018-07	5	3	1
699	699	great ballooning experience	it looks like there is a lot to do in Goreme other that balloons, but we had just 2,5 days, so we focused at balloons. and watching them. great experience. our provider was Butterfly and everything was ok.	2018-07	5	3	1
700	700	A must visit place!	Excellent ..was not expecting this it to be as intriguing as it was. The Red Tour we took made all the difference, as our exceptional tour guide (Behram) explained everything in detail and was responsive to all our questions. Sunset and sunrise in Cappodocia was surreal. Unfortunately our balloon ride got cancelled due to weather, so make sure you have at least 2 days reserved for the ride.	2018-08	5	3	1
701	701	Must ser	It u r in capadocia u must go there , its unique and very nice , try to take a guide with u to understand everything , they r good and take only 5$	2018-07	5	3	1
702	702	Living History	The whole area is so full of amazing photo opportunities but the simple beauty of the churches with their surviving frescos is truly a wonder to behold.	2018-07	5	3	1
703	703	Nice place	Its a fun place.. Lots of photo opps.. N the rock formations here r amazing.. And the hidden paintings n churches in it r a gem	2018-06	4	3	1
704	704	Beautiful place	Goreme National Park is truly a natural wonder with so many beautiful fairy chimneys and historical significance.	2018-07	5	3	1
705	705	Adventure continues	We went to the park as part of our own bucket list. The park is worth to goto for the experience of caves in stone. Habited a long time ago. Formations all natural which is stunning. I wish the government would invest to keep parks all clean and tidy so much litter and poorly maintained facilities they should be ashamed of themselves!	2018-07	4	3	0
706	706	Great Rock formations for your imagination!	We drove to Goreme to see the fantastic rock formations and drove to many places to explore the region.  The outdoor museum was great, Totally walkable for kids and old people.	2018-07	5	3	1
707	707	Nice historical place	Visited one hot morning during our stay in Goreme. Walked all the way from town to here, about 2 kms away. But it was an uphill walk and very tiring.Took service of a guide who gave us a tour of the place. Was good as otherwise we would not have understood anything. Enjoyed the couple of hours we spent here.Nice and interesting place. Should visit when in Goreme.	2018-05	4	3	1
708	708	interesting histroy	go with a guide so you can learn about the place. its nice to look around. however not as pretty as other places for taking pictures but still worth going to for a couple of hours. easy to get to not far from goreme centre.	2018-07	4	3	1
709	709	Goreme - fantastic place	The Goreme National Park is unique. Amazing landscapes, special buildings, caves and a lot of learning about a very special culture.	2018-07	5	3	1
710	710	Scenic hike/walk	Worth a walk through , stunning mountain scenery . Lots of stairs but once you get past them , there are a lot of cave churches and natural rock formations	2018-07	4	3	1
711	711	So close and realistic	The national park offers you an in-depth view of how life would have been in a couple of hours time. You should visit and do the walk. recommend early morning after the hot air balloon ride as it gets tiring when you do it post noon with a shining sun above.	2018-06	4	3	1
712	712	Beautiful	It is a really beautiful park filled with stunning natural structures. A guide could be useful. Definitely worth a visit!	2018-07	5	3	1
713	713	Goreme national park	Simply amazing.Take a guide with You.He will tell so many histories...You will understand how the Christians grow up and what happened when the Turkish people conquered the place.Really interesting.	2018-07	5	3	1
714	714	Unique	Simply awesome and unique place,our second visit in 8 years still feels amazing hope to comeback again soon	2018-06	5	3	1
715	715	Unique	You can see church caves dating back thousands of years ago. Some of them have murals too. The rock formations are really unique.	2018-06	4	3	0
716	716	Go, just go.	Wonderful history like no where else in the world. Go, just go. Lunch time is better as the crowds will be at lunch.	2018-07	5	3	1
717	717	Interesting	There is so much to see, quite different to any other place in the world because of the beautiful rock formations formed thousands of years ago by volcanic eruptions. We didn’t hire a car because we drive on the opposite side of the road in our country and thought that it might be too difficult but I would definitely suggest you hire a car. The roads are absolutely quiet and it’s so easy to drive there instead of having to bargain with taxi drivers etc. I also would suggest you rather drive around yourself than taking tours which can waste do much of your valuable time with unnecessary stops. That way you can visit all the different stops and do all the tours yourself. Really a beautiful natural wonderland	2018-07	4	3	1
718	718	Absolutely amazing scenery	This place is so beautiful! If you are in goreme you have to see this. It will only take less than one hour to finish it and well worthwhile! Be sure to take your camera!	2018-02	5	3	1
719	719	Very interesting place, recommend to visit with the guide	Very interesting place, recommend to visit with the guide, it is so old and amazing you definitely must visit it	2018-05	5	3	1
720	720	amazing	had researched this area and chose to stay in goreme based on this, but the online info and pictures did not do this place justice, almost everywhere you looked was cave dwellings and fairy chimneys with absolutely amazing landscape,we had intended to hire mountain bikes but pleased we never as the terrain is so rugged and hilly pleased we never. the goreme open air museum is within waking distance of the town and costs 25tl, as is rose valley, uchisar castle is about 2.5 mile away.goreme itself has a good sized bus station which serves coaches and local dolmus along with a taxi rank, many bars and good restaurants, with some little supermarkets and souvenir shops with very friendly localsonly stayed 2.5 days, hopefully will return for a longer visit has their is so much to see and do loved this place.should have given myself a week at least	2018-06	5	3	1
721	721	Great Visit	The park is full of amazing landscape. You just can´t believe your eyes. It looks as a Lunar landscape.We had a great time and memories for life.	2018-06	5	3	1
722	722	Very interesting	Several places closed. Extra payment required for the best preserved church within the Open Air Museum itself.	2018-06	4	3	1
723	723	Gorgeous little village	Spent a week end in Goreme to visit the multiple underground cities nearby and of course going on the hot air balloon adventures .The scenery there is just magical and the people super friendly !	2018-06	5	3	1
724	724	Dream landscape	Most beautiful landscapes! we did a lot of hikes and very early morning visits to the starting balloons!!	2018-06	5	3	1
725	725	Impressive Cave Churches	This area in Cappadocia consists of several cave Churches used by early Christians to practise their faith without persecution. Some of  the caves have beautiful paintings which the Christian leaders used to share their faith with new believers. Very humbling to immerse oneself in the area.	2018-06	4	3	1
726	726	AMAZING!!!	This must be the most féerique place in the world! Air balloon worth every cent and should be in everybody’s bucket list.	2018-06	5	3	1
727	727	One of the most important sightseeing in Turkey.	"Göreme National Park is one of the most important sightseeing in Turkey.  Although ""important"" seems not a good term for tourists, but if you are interested in geology, science, and history.  You should visit here.  The underground cities tell you how hard was the life for people 1,000 years ago."	2018-06	5	3	1
728	728	Amazing step,back in time	Even though I had seen information on the Park before we traveled nothing had quite prepared me for the sheer size and scope of the geology and history  laid out before us as we drove into Goreme. There are lots of different ways of exploring the Park for people of all mobility levels from the Open Air Museum to the underground passages through to watching the sunset over the Rose valley with a glass of the local wine - however Goreme's star attraction must be the opportunity to take a hot air balloon ride at dawn as one of the 100+ balloons that launch every morning - sublime. The town itself provided a variety of restaurants providing some classic Turkish cuisine and a variety of arts and craft wares for sale. All round definitely worth the effort to get there.	2018-06	5	3	1
729	729	What Cappadocia is famous for	So if you've decided to visit Cappadocia, surely this must be your first port of call ?! You can spend easily a good 2 to 3 hours walking through the fairy chimneys and cave churches, preferably with a good guide. The place can get busy and no photography is allowed inside the churches (why, oh why !!).	2018-05	4	3	1
730	730	Tour with Trek - Cappadocia - What to Wear	Anyone visiting Cappadocia on tour during summer months should expect lots of sunshine and higher temps. Also, it is good to expect to climb stairs and some hills and do some easy up-and-down-hill trekking. This said, make sure you pack proper trek shoes. A pair that will provide you the needed traction from loose sand and give you a more enjoyable and secure trek. I stress this because I didn’t pack mine and regretted it the whole time. I brought trek trousers, light weight shirt and a hat but didn’t pack my trek shoes. While my city sneakers were better than the pretty sandals other tourists were wearing, proper hiking shoes would have been way better. I want that for you!	2018-06	4	3	1
731	731	Very special	I am totally impressed with the Goreme National Park, especially the Dark Church. I was shocked with the church's beauty. You have to pay more 10 lira to get in but it is totally worth. This is my most favorite sofar in Capadocia. I really love it. You should not miss the open museum and the Dark Church! I am sure I will want to come back to see the Dark church again	2018-05	5	3	0
732	732	Hype!	Honestly speaking we may have not enjoyed the place because the guide was so pathetic. We had booked it via Goreme Tours n this was the first stop in the red tour. There are few churches and rock formations but we don't know any history about the same. We could not understand a word of what he spoke as he spoke in a completely flat tone with no interest. It was very very hot so please carry an umbrella or cap. There is a lot of climbing steps so Ppl with joint issues should be careful. You get some really nice Donduruma outside the museum. The gift shop within the museum is nice but very expensive.	2018-06	3	3	1
733	733	Good place to visit	It is good place to visit,you will like this landscape and nature,this place will take you to some other world ,just try to reach early at opening times so you enjoy more before tour rush starts to come in.	2018-05	4	3	1
734	734	Another planet this is	This must be the Homeland of Anakin Skywalker and the Ewoks. They were not at home in June, but make no mistake, they do live here! 😄 Spectacular landscape!	2018-06	5	3	0
735	735	Spectacular !	We arrived as soon as the park opened as we had heard it was very popular and would soon get very busy, We had no problem parking at this time but noticed it was a bit chaotic as we were leaving!  There is so much to see and explore in the caves, it really is an amazing place. There is a lot of climbing and a good number of steps but it is worth the effort to see as much as possible. There are numerous murals and small coffins and it is hard to believe that people could survive here, We were fortunate in that it was a warm, dry day but we knew people who had visited the day before and were drenched in a sudden thunderstorm - there is no shelter apart from the gift shop. It was free to enter but there is a small charge to enter one of the churches. I would advise wearing sensible shoes suitable for uphill walking and certainly not flip flops that some girls were wearing! The gift shop was very nice with a good variety of items to buy. We were there for 2 hours, but all very enjoyable. There are guided tours if required and some seats around the park if you need a rest.	2018-05	5	3	1
736	736	Interesting history to explore	We really enjoyed exploring this area. Walking distance from Goremë and well signposted. Fascinating to see how these natural wonders have been inhabited and used over the generations. Be sure to stop in for a traditional turkish ice cream and coffee on your way out.	2018-06	4	3	1
737	737	Spectacular	This place is absolutely beautiful. You can see different constructions into the caves and learn a lot. You can go by yourself or into a tour. I went into the red line tour, but I would enjoy more going by myself as there are different explanations with the audioguide that you miss with the only one hour that you have with the tour. Although the shop outside is quite expensive, you can find high quality souvenirs not easy to find somewhere else.	2018-05	5	3	1
738	738	Please do not touch the murals!!	During our visit to the Karanlik Kilise, which houses the most complete and stunning of murals in the complex, the staff in-charged was trying to coax a few liras out of visitors by inviting them to touch the murals. And some tourists did. PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH THE MURALS, AND DO NOT TIP THOSE THAT ENCOURAGE YOU TO.Unlike the rest of the complex, these delicate murals have survived centuries intact. The last thing they need are our greasy fingers wearing them out.On the review of the museum, the complex remains impressive but overrun by tour groups (many of which are from China). Visiting in the early morning and late afternoon should be more intimate, when crowds are reduced.	2018-05	5	3	1
739	739	Awesomeness	An out of the world experience, we visited as a part of Red Tour offered in Goreme Cappadocia. It’s worth visiting a good 2-3 hours there... replete with history ... a must for all ages	2018-05	5	3	1
740	740	Wonderful landscape	The landscape is just other worldly. The rock formations, chimneys and surrounding mountains make the place just amazing	2018-04	5	3	1
741	741	The entire area is stunning	an organized tour with well informed guides is very inexpensive. You can also walk for miles around the stunning landscape.	2018-05	5	3	1
742	742	Interesting history at Goreme Open Air Museum	We were lucky to have a knowledgeable tour guide with us, otherwise it would have been rather uninteresting if you don't know the history behind it. I think they also provide Audio guides, but not sure how helpful those are. Good day trip though, as there are not so many other things to do there.	2018-05	4	3	1
743	743	A must visit when in Cappadocia, Turkey	Yes this palce us a must visit...!I viisited Gerome in April 2018 with Group Tour from Indonesia. This place is very unique and amazing.You can imagine the stone rocks with churches in it,  with wall paintingvdated back from 5 centuries ago...!!It is instagrammable...!	2018-04	5	3	1
744	744	What a view !!!	What a beautiful place in Capadocia, a unique view of the valley, very special moment at this place.	2018-05	5	3	1
745	745	Amazing place	Beautiful and amazing.. worth a visit.. an hour is enough to explore.. interesting place.. enjoy :) :)	2018-05	5	3	1
746	746	Less than I expected	Before my travel I read lot of positive reviews about this place and I expected to see more. Interesting was Karanlik kilise, but many churches loks pretty similar	2018-05	3	3	1
747	747	Great rocks	Very touristy, but why not? Most accommodation in the rocks and can do quad bikes or horses. Took a long walk up Pigeon Valley, very nice but was a bit cold. Late Spring would be best I think. Watch for dead end paths as it’s easy to get stuck	2018-02	4	3	0
748	748	Are we in Mars?	It definitely felt like we were out of this world! We enjoyed a good hike in the park, explored some of the caves and just soaked in the  fascination of what nature has created.	2018-04	5	3	1
749	749	Heritage site	Its a 25 minute walk from Goreme town center. The walk is quite pleasant as one can enjoy the scenery and typical Cappadocian landscape. The open air museum is a series of chimney rock formations (about 40) which were carved and used as churches and chapel from the 9th century onwards. Most of the wall paintings and frescoes have been damaged and hardly few can be seen. But if you have seen a few of them, you can skip the remaining as they are very similar.	2018-05	4	3	1
750	750	Nice for a morning walk	"We visited the Open Air Museum on our last day. The area open to the public is not very big, so you can cover it in roughly 2 hours. Definitely a power workout for your legs, as you will need to climb for the first section. It is a selection of churches mainly, so for me it was a ""see one,seen them all"" kind of a vibe. The landscape surrounding it is beautiful, of course, but that is applicable for all the Kapadokya region. You can however take a nice walk, and if you are passionate about old Christian art, you might be more impressed."	2018-05	3	3	1
751	751	Explore outside the town	Goreme is a great place to base yourself while in the Cappadoccia region, there is plenty do to, but the town itself is pretty touristy with all the shops selling the exact same souvineers and the restaurants being mediocre/catering more to tourists than showcasing the beauty of Turkish cuisine.	2018-05	4	3	1
752	752	Göreme must do	This place is incredibly well preserved. Fairy chimney rock formations, well preserved churches with some frescos till intact. Worth the 30 lira to get in, which includes access to the church across the road from the open air museum. Make sure you stop in after the museum! This place gets busy during the day so I would recommend going early to beat the crowds.	2018-05	5	3	1
753	753	Good	The place is good but could have been really good had they provided enough information about the stuff there. I felt a disconnect with the place due to lack of appropriate information. I could see some really old blocks but could not identify what they were (the type of room). Do not provide the complete details, but something as simple as a 'Living room' ' Meeting area' etc might help.There was information about the churches but not the other sections. Also, the entry fee is a bit high for the place I feel.Could have maintained a lot better.	2018-05	3	3	1
754	754	Incredibly impressive	This is definitely worth visiting and spending some time seeing these amazing rock structures. The old churches that are located in some of the rocks are amazing. The canyons are difficult to hike along but worth having a go if you are brave!	2018-05	5	3	1
755	755	Well Worth a Visit	We walked here from our hotel in central Cappadocia.  It's a bit of a hike, but not bad.  Really worth going to see, we did this activity without a guide.	2018-03	5	3	1
756	756	Great hiking tour	Great to see the same sights we saw from the balloon at ground level.Fairy Chimneys are almost too nice to be real.	2018-04	5	3	1
757	757	A fantastic valley that seems like out of world	Although Goreme national park has a big area (nearly 40km2) Visiting 3 0r 4 part of it is enough. İf you are a fast traveller you might finish it in one day, but generally it takes two day. All area and also some villages in there seems like an another planet. Zelve is ano f these fantastis parts without an entrance fee. There is a monastary valley with an entrance fee(30 TL , free with museum card) and it worths. There are more than 10 cave churches with iconas and graves in it. Living (cookink, eating, sleeping) quarters of monks all in caves. Most of them from 9-11 th centuries. Best time to visit according to me spring and autumn. You have to walk a lot.	2018-05	5	3	1
758	758	Pleasant sight	Huge place to visit. Maybe will take more than an hour to explore by foot. So unique and interesting!	2018-04	5	3	1
759	759	So beautiful	The highlight of the whole Turkey trip would surely be Cappadocia - its unique landscape with unusual rock formations. The Goreme Open Air Museum is a compound of churches - expect lots of walking and climbing up narrow stairs.	2018-04	5	3	1
760	760	A walk through the 10 - 12th Centuries	Goreme Open Air Museum a must visit when in Cappadocia.  The museum shows a range of beautiful monasteries each with its own church.  Walking through the museum one gets to enter the 10 - 12 centuries.The museum is a UNESCO Heritage site since 1984.	2018-04	5	3	1
761	761	OMG	Oh my god a place that needs to be visited.  The national parks where you can climb & run free.  Relaxing day out for young & old	2018-04	5	3	1
762	762	Stunning Place	This place caught my heart. Not in a million years I thought it will be that magic and relaxing! Love it and definitely will be back for the surrounding areas!	2018-04	5	3	1
763	763	Fantastic place.	I loved it and was so interesting.Very busy and when bus loads in people were pushing and shoving to get up steps.Go early to avoid this as it's a lovely place.	2018-04	5	3	0
764	764	Absolutely fantastic	It is unique in the world. Loved it.. You are in another dimension. You lose the concept of time and location. Very well kept.	2018-04	5	3	0
765	765	Very interesting	It was very interesting and worth visiting. However, it could be tiring and there are many steps which would be difficult for less able people. I suggest to have water and snack with you.	2018-04	5	3	1
766	766	History	I didn’t know that is a place like this on earth!!!beautiful and amazing!! So much history in so much caves!! I’ll come again!!	2018-04	5	3	1
767	767	Awestruck with its land formation and history!	Göreme National Park will leave you awestruck. Actually the whole landscape of Cappadocia is amazing and should be seen in one’s lifetime. It’s like a different planet altogher. And how Christianity used the natural land formation to its advantage gives religion a place in this rich country’s heritage.	2018-03	5	3	1
768	768	Cappadocia	Great place but lacks good review. Ask the guide to bring you to the small town where local tourists go. Really cool place just to have coffee n chill	2018-03	5	3	1
769	769	Spend at least 2-3 days here!	Dear friends, Spend at least 2-3 days here to plunge yourself in the atmosphere of this place. We planned 2, but spent 3 days and regret we had not taken the opportunity to camp in that park. Especially we liked quiet Red Valley. We saw two camps and are sure that those guys took all from that. Thanks to all who keep this place clean and merely untouched. And, of course, this place is ideal for hot air balloons.	2018-04	5	3	1
770	770	Amazing Landscape	It is one of the most visited attraction of Cappadocia. You get to see amazing landscapes of Volcanic rocks. You have to walk around the place to get the feel of the place. Many churches, monastries etc are located inside and a glimpse of how people lived in caves in past. If you take a guide you get to know all sort of stories (Some real and some cooked up), audio guide are also available. You can easily spend 1-2 hours in this place.	2018-03	4	3	1
771	771	Unspeakable view - best to enjoy it with quad bikes 🏍	Can’t say more than show you the pics ,)...More challenging with quad bikes ride... we didn’t do it as we’re not feel safe enough with our kids - but managed to take photo on it yeaaaahhh 😜Ensure to say min 3 days to enjoy full of Cappadocian has offered- explore both side, each sides at least need 1 day.PS:- think twice to buy any jewelry at Cappadocia especially the gold one ☝️- if you plan to go to Istanbul - do the shopping there 😉 - went straight to a silver shop just in front of (left side) grand bazaar or go to Anchor shop just before Arasta Bazar 👍	2018-03	5	3	1
772	772	Good visit	Bit of a trek to walk but visited this place on arrival. I think a good introduction to cappadocia and you should book tours the following day.	2018-04	4	3	1
773	773	Easy walk	"Plenty of trails that you could follow. We were dropped off near the Open Air Museum and took a walk through the national park back into Goreme. Easy enough and it was fun climbing up and down the ""gnomes hats""."	2018-03	5	3	1
774	774	Worthwhile experience!	A party of two, we managed to hike for a crazy whole day starting from Red/Rose valley (entrance from opposite of Goreme Air Museum) managed to continue all the way to Uchisar city via Cavusin (covering Love Valley to Pigeon Valley). Was quite ambitious and tiring hike but doable although I won’t recommend to do them all in one go! Great sceneries although the trails are badly mark so it’s so easy to get lost, especially everything look a bit similar after sometime. Regret nothing but the sore legs on the next day 😂	2018-03	4	3	0
775	775	incredible and other worldly	Goreme Open-Air Museum is located only 1 1/2 kms. from the village, but wear solid footwear as you will spend hours of walking and climbing in order to see everything. The Museum is a vast complex of monasteries and churches, most dating from the 10-11-12th centuries. These beautiful rock cut churches contain beautiful frescoes that still retain their vivid colours.  My favourites included the 6-7 storey Nunnery, the colourful Apple Church, and the striking Dark Church. The Open Air Museum has been a member of the UNESCO World Heritage list since 1984, and was one of the first two UNESCO sites in Turkey. Plan to spend the entire day here, folks!	2018-03	5	3	1
776	776	A must see Place	Wear comfortable clothes and footwear and take your time and alot of pictures :D don't forget to visit the church inside.	2018-03	5	3	1
777	777	Other worldly	The range and scope of the rock formations look like they are from another planet. Sadly, the trash and quad runners that they allow are very much from ours (which is the reason for four, not five stars. Nature is awesome. People ruin things). Take one of the horseback riding tours to see the best of it up close. It offers a very inexpensive, but an intimate experience.	2018-03	4	3	1
778	778	Get out and walk around	A hikers paradise, canyons full of caves to explore, fields with workers offering tea just to be polite. Balloon rides , horses if you cannot walk	2018-03	5	3	1
779	779	Seeing is Believing...one of the wonders of this world !	Out of this world sight. 1000s of lavatic rock caves formation that 1000s of years ago housed 1000s of people seeking refuge from the enemies. It goes deep several metres down and 6 levels down. They're actual caves where rooms have been carved out into kitchens, bedrooms, pantries, cellars or even churches. There would also be chimneys that allow sunlight to shine through to tell the dwellers that it's day time or otherwise. The lavatic stones are good in regulating the temperature inside the caves.This is one place you must visit if and when you are in Turkey	2018-02	4	3	0
780	780	Amazing..	it is beautiful place.. it’s got beauties in the summer and also in the winter. Try to stay in cave rooms but some hotels are selling not real cave rooms, be careful!	2018-02	5	3	0
781	781	Astonishing	An amazing place, definitely worth a visit and totally worth paying the extra 10 TRY for the dark chapel. The frescos are incredible and views amazing as always. You should keep in mind your national park ticket also includes entrance to another bigger church a few meters down the road.	2018-02	5	3	1
782	782	Turkey by Lexusman	It's very difficult to imagine how people in the pass live in the cave!! Natural is amazing where you'd better look from your eyes. If you read the history before, it will be more fun! EnjoyJam Lexusman Bangkok Thailand	2018-02	5	3	1
783	783	discover area	certainly you can walking here for hours and enjoy than .amazing view.you will fall in thought that how people had lived here.	2018-02	4	3	1
784	784	A marvel of tunnel and rooms underground	Nothing more fun for teen boys especially,  than to duck, crawl and explore the tunnels of this ancient underground city.  It is almost unbelievable that this huge city was created so many years ago, and still in remarkable condition.   Our guide Eykoud made it such a great experience for us.  Happy to let the boys explore a little and make the most of the day.  Also a must see while in Goreme.	2022-05	5	4	1
785	785	A very unexpected highlight	A very unique and interesting underground city!A series of narrow passageways that lead to rooms, living spaces, kitchens, churches, store rooms, barns, etc etc. There's not much information around and im unsure if there is an audio guide, could well be worth exploring with a guide, we didnt have a guide and still had a great time exploring.So areas are rather tight and most of the ceilings are fairly low. If you suffer from claustrophobia this place is not for you.	2022-03	5	4	1
786	786	hidden city	very good caves we went there by the tour .Kaymaklı is the largest and most popular underground city of the country. However, only 4 floors are accessible by visitors. As you walk around, you may observe various rooms and halls, kitchens, and a winery.	2022-03	5	4	1
787	787	An unexpected highlight of a trip to this region	.   Looking up and down the ventilation shaft deep inside the underground city gives you a sense of just how mammoth this city was and is, and seeing the ancient carved boulders that close off certain sections gives you a sense of how frightening and purposeful the experience must have been.We did this underground city (the largest, occupied by early christians when in pursuit from the Romans) as part of a private Green Tour of Capadoccia organized by Pupa Travel.   We were pleased to find that our museum pass for Turkey worked here.Two tunnels were very narrow/low ceilings, similar to a pyramid tunnel, but otherwise very manageable and plenty of fresh air.	2021-12	5	4	1
788	788	Interesting place!	Interesting place! We came on our own and walked around exploring the underground city and it was pretty cool.  Pretty impressive that people were able to dig out all these tunnels and actually lived down there.  We ran into a tour guide when we were in there and we agreed to book him for half an hour to learn a little more about the place.   He was ok - his accent made it a bit difficult to understand and he didn't really tell us that much.  Overall, we enjoyed our time and it's a place worth checking out.	2021-10	4	4	1
789	789	If you don't claustrophobia you must see.	If you don't have a fear of confined spaces you must visit. As we informed this is the biggest underground city of that around. Some of tunnels are very tight and you can be scare, be aware if you have claustrophobia !	2021-10	4	4	0
790	790	Fascinating	A visit to one of the underground cities is really a must and quite fascinating. Personally, I visited just after opening to miss the tour groups and paid extra to have my own guide, who will approach you once you get through the turnstiles. Unfortunately there is not an accompanying museum to show the history and, not that I disbelief them,  but you are reliant on your guide's explanation.	2021-09	4	4	0
791	791	Interesting place	Came as part of a tour. The place goes quite far into the ground and it is very interesting, especially fi you have a guide who can explain things, but the stairs can get very tight and going down or up can make you claustrophobic. One person on our tour could not go past the first level because of this. Overall it was quite interesting.	2021-10	4	4	1
792	792	Better than Derinkuyu	"Some 30 min drive south from Goreme will take you to the best underground city in all Cappadocia - the Kaymakli. Although it's smaller than Derinkuyu which is further south, this one was more interesting to me as there're more to see.In front of the site is a parking lot and entry fee is 60 TL (6 Euros), but it is included in the ""Cappadocia Pass"" which I strongly advise.The maze of underground tunnels with living rooms, churches, supply storage rooms both for food and live animals is amazing. The whole town was built under the ground town and connected with it so people could easily head down for shelter during enemy attacks.Beware of very uneven terrain, narrow passages with reduced height, so it'll not be suitable for everyone. Count on 1,5 to 2 hrs for a visit."	2021-08	4	4	0
793	793	Outstanding!	We viewed this sight with a private guide, which I highly recommend. It was a great introduction and we felt like we saw a lot and understood a lot about the people and the history. Really special place - definitely should go.	2021-07	5	4	1
794	794	Excellent architecture	How could they build this underground city going multiple levels down all those years ago. I visited this city and still cannot believe it! The various aspects of wells, food storage areas, wine making areas, sanitation areas, etc are so well thought out and well executed. Highly recommended to visit.	2021-07	5	4	1
795	795	Highly recommended: Fascinating and highly unusual history	Fascinating and very unusual place. An entire underground city at many levels. Very elaborate and amazing. Shows human ingenuity and effort from ancient times. I have never seen anything quite like this! We took a guide which was a great idea because he explained a whole lot which put the objects and different sections into context. Very worthwhile. They accept the Turkey Museum card. Allow 1 to 2 hours.	2021-07	5	4	1
796	796	The best of Cappadocia's underground cities	Of the three underground cities I saw in Cappadocia (Kaymakli, Derinkuyu, and Ozkonak), Kaymakli was by far my favorite, as there is the most to see here and they have fantastic guides who, for a fee, will show you as much as they can. So if you only have time to do one underground city in Cappadocia, make it Kaymakli.	2021-04	5	4	1
797	797	Incredible engineering	Incredible engineering. we took taxi from our hotel since we missed the tour and we still had an amazing experience discovering the city ourselves. is the biggest underground city in the area. had lots of fun, took amazing pictures and was incredible to see how advice their were back in the day. will recommend to anyone	2021-02	5	4	1
798	798	Very interesting...	It’s one of the world heritage that has made me drop my jaw . How native people were living that time , stashing theirselves or food , livestock etc .They could stay between 1 to 6 months without having problem . Having drinkable water , could do all their needs . Planing everything even if a invasor wanted to go in how get ride of him . 🤯🤯🤯🤯	2020-02	5	4	1
799	799	Amazing	Absolutely fascinating to think that people once lived underground. Mazes that go deep into earth... very narrow and very low ceilings. If you are claustrophobic I would pass on this one.	2020-12	5	4	1
800	800	Fascinating	We visited both this and Derinkuyu underground cities, and Kaymakli was more interesting. More authentic with original tunnels and lots of options to explore. It was more cramped but tons of spaces and freedom to look around. Better lighting for photos too. Would definitely recommend if you have time for only one.	2020-11	5	4	1
801	801	Interesting	Very interested and amazing to see how people long time ago hid themselves and lived underground. We went there around 10:00 but was not open, actually it opened 11:00. Not sure if the time has changed due to COVID pandemic. Some path inside underground was very narrow and you may need to squat down to pass through. So, you need to be watched out for your head.	2020-11	5	4	0
802	802	Historical place	The underground city was my favorite part of the Green Tour. Such an amazing place full of history and well preserved. We were really lucky to be able to enjoy seeing this place without massive crowds. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and gave us lots of information on this place.	2020-11	5	4	1
803	803	Definitely the most impressive underground city	Right now it's not packed and it's the best underground city we've seen. It's a lot more intricate, winding, and deep than some smaller ones. I think this is the definitive one to see, especially due to the cool tunnels.	2020-11	5	4	0
804	804	A new experience	Opened in 1964, this is one of the 36 underground cities in Capadoccia. The underground city consists of  8 floors but we only get to see 4 of them.  Our guide was really knowledgeable and gave us all the historical information about the cave. We enjoyed our tour.	2020-09	5	4	1
805	805	This is the underground city to go to	It was very interesting to see all the different levels and rooms.  You can crawl around and into many rooms and through small openings.  Well lit and ventilated.This is definately the one to go to.  Derinkuyu is not nearly as good or detailed as this.  Much less crowded.  We spent a hour here and could have spent more	2020-08	5	4	0
806	806	Very interesting	Interesting to see how humans are able to build this underground city in ancient times! It was like a maze but there were small coloured arrows to guide visitors on the exit and in points. Having a tour guide was useful as well! Kaymakli is wider compared to the other famous Derinkuyu underground city. Worth a visit!	2019-06	4	4	1
807	807	Best visit during off peak	Best to visit in winter or in the early morning before the tour groups clog up the narrow passageways. Also get a guide because the place is a maze and it is hard to distinguish which are the ovens, wineries, living room etc just by looking at the holes.	2020-02	5	4	1
808	808	Amazing ancient multi-level underground city	Kaymakli Underground City is on Ihlara Road, 10 kms from Derinkuyu.  The underground city is under a great hill named the Citadel of Kaymaklı and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Parts of the city date back to the Hittites and Phrygian Period (circa 3000 BC). The city has been used for a variety of purposes over the ages: sheltering domestic animals, storage of goods or wine, security when the area was under attack, safe passage through the tunnels, and sanctuary for  Christians living in the region from the 4th century on.  An estimated 3,500 people could live in the city.  The inhabitants created living spaces, cellars, storage rooms, communal kitchens, workshops, churches and stables around a maze of nearly one hundred tunnels dug into the soft volcanic tuff (some rooms are still in use today).  Spaces were organized around ventilation shafts, some reaching as deep as 8 floors (80m, only 4 levels are currently open to the public today).  The first floor was primarily used to stable animals.  A passage leads to a church (single nave and two apses) on the second floor down.  The third level contains primarily living areas, with storage rooms, wineries and a communal kitchen.  A large andesite block was used as a work area for hammering melted copper into tools.  The 4th level contains storage rooms and buried earthenware jars to hold wine.  The rooms are well lit and the tunnels are not too steep, but the low, narrow and sloping passages may be uncomfortable for those with claustrophobia.  The underground city is a popular place, a visit early in the morning, around lunch time or late in the afternoon may avoid some of the crowds (us!).  Kaymakli Underground City is open from 8am-6.15pm every day, with an entry fee of ₺42.	2019-05	5	4	0
809	809	Must go!	I felt like I was in an Indiana Jones movie! It was great. But  you cannot visit if you have health issues like claustrophobia.	2019-12	5	4	1
810	810	Life as a Hobbit	We stopped by on our way to Konya. Interesting though not for the claustrophobic. Surprisingly warm underground in spite of the bitter cold outside. Interesting look at a different surprisingly cosy lifestyle.	2020-01	4	4	1
811	811	Amazing	Imagine a small city eight floors underground ! That is Kaymakli for you. Due to safety concerns, only four floors are open to the public. These underground dwellings dates back to the 7th century and has been used by the local population over different centuries as a means to protect themselves from invasion of the Arabs, Mongols and Romans as per the times. This is certainly not for very senior citizens and those with claustrophobia, as we have to go through tunnels, some of them narrow. There are two  tunnels where we have to squat and move forward. My thigh muscles were aching the next day. Keep in mind that once you enter a tunnel, you cannot turn back as there are people behind you. I am tall and hence was initially hesitant to go in, but got the confidence to do so, once I saw some tall and burly people go in. I am glad I did as the place is amazing. Wonder how they did it centuries back with primitive equipments.	2019-08	5	4	0
812	812	Unique experience	It’s a unique experience , understanding the history and walking through the underground city was fascinating . However it can get quite packed with tourists , we visited during not so peak season but still there were a couple of tourist buses , there are small tunnels which you need to walk through on your fours and if there are too many people it can get a bit scaryIf you’re claustrophobic avoid this place , if not it’s worth a visit	2019-12	4	4	1
813	813	Fascinating	Amazing to see how people lived so long ago. Suggest you have a guide to take you around. Not for you if you claustrophobic. We went when it was not busy so getting around was perfect.definitely worth a visit.	2019-12	5	4	1
814	814	One of the largest Underground City ! Truly Eye Opening !	It is known as one of the largest underground cities here in Cappadocia and said to have existed since the Hittite period. The early christians have found this place and created such cities to hide from the Romans and found sanctuary in those rock structures. The feeling is medieval and the rooms are functionally dug out to have areas for animals, kitchens, cooking area in the ground, rooms, ventilation shaft, water well etc. It can be claustrophobic for some especially when multiple tour groups converge and do feel how the walls can be easily dug out just using your finger. There are even roller doors to close off certain entrance during invasion and holes from ceilings and ground to spear the enemies if you spy hard enough. True demonstration of ingenuity of humanity and will to survive when under persecution and yet thriving under immense hostile environment . Hats off ! Highly recommended !!	2019-12	5	4	0
815	815	Must-see while in Cappadocia	"If you go to Cappadocia and miss visiting an underground city, you will regret it.   Kaymakly is easy to visit, they have only 5% of the underground city open to the public, and in 1.5 hours you can manage to slowly see all that it has to offer.  We did not hire a guide, and we did well, many of the features are common sense.   Others, such as the way they used the stone ""handles"" to tie their sheep and other animals were not that obvious but we managed to understand it anyway.    We went through the place twice, to better see it without the tour crowds that came in with us.     Do not miss this visit!"	2019-11	5	4	0
816	816	Glad we did it	Glad that we did this one but I could have done without the large tours we passed (at least we were able to pass most within he cave). It just felt way too crowded going through some of those small tunnels if you’re stuck behind a big group. Once we passed the groups, it was nice. Definitely a couple places where you may have to bend but nothing too bad.glad we experienced it.	2019-11	4	4	1
817	817	Unbelievable experience- a must do!	This was an outstanding experience. I would do it with a tour guide do get the most out of it. It is amazing people were successfully able to live underground in the way. The air shaft is amazing to see. I do not advise people with bad knees of bad backs do this site because there are long stretches of tunnels you have to squat and walk to get to next level. Once you go to second level, it is one way - no return due to narrow passage. I am told people with Claustrophobia have problems too, but it is only in the passages from level to level that it gets tight. The other chambers are wide.	2019-11	5	4	0
818	818	New experience	Nice place to visit and get some new experience in your life It's good to give it a try with no guidance	2019-11	4	4	1
819	819	Good if there's only few visitor in the underground at the same time	There were other group from high school so it's quite crowded.  It is underground, small space and labyrinth-like - it's unfortunate we could not go round to explore the area as it's too crowded.  It's best if the government could apply the same limitation as in Goreme Open Air Museum.Our guide - Mustafa from Pupa Travel is very helpful and informative.  At least, with his explanation help us to enjoy a bit in the underground city.	2019-11	3	4	1
820	820	Very cool place (literally as well!)	Took a short drive from Gerome to Kaymakli Underground City. This is the widest underground city in the area, the deepest one being Derinkuyu which is further south. Children below 8 get free entry. We paid 126TL for 2 adults and one child above the age of 8. Follow the red arrows to go in further and the blue to exit. The paths are rather narrow and the rooms are marked as to what they were used for. The children enjoyed exploring the routes but there were some that were really narrow. We passed an air vent which showed how far down the city goes. Very amazing place. Would definitely recommend to visit!	2019-11	4	4	1
821	821	A Safe Refuge 100 ft Underground	This was a great tour but not for the claustrophobic.  There are 5 levels of this underground sanctuary where Christians hid from persecuting Romans and later Ottomans.  There are bedrooms, living rooms, stables, a kitchen, a winery and a last sanctuary guarded by a rolling stone door.	2019-11	5	4	1
822	822	Mysterious underground city	We went there at 9 am and no body was there , it was great because the tunnels are very narrow and if there was crowded we couldn't walk quickly . A wonderful experience !!	2019-10	5	4	1
823	823	Overrated	Unfortunately this is the most overrated attraction. When I went it was so over populated with tour groups that I was literally trapped for quite awhile, unable to go forward or backward, in or out, very tight and uncomfortable if you are like me ( 2 m height). There are not many signs or explanations of the tunnell rooms and passageways. Better to read about it or watch a video.	2019-10	1	4	0
824	824	A piece of history	This place is a world heritage site. Only the top three floors are accessible to the public but it's worth a visit. We were advised to negotiate with and employ a guide which we did. Mustapha was well informed and made the tour much more interesting but more importantly, he led us on a sensible route through the many tunnels. We would have been wandering aimlessly without him. It should be noted that some tunnels require bending double to get through.	2019-09	4	4	1
825	825	Join the Crowds	This very popular attraction is up to 3000 years-old and covers 5+ levels underground. It is a bit of a tight squeeze in places, and should not be attempted if you are large or unwell.  You will see living quarters, food storage, stables, a winery, etc. all underground and fortified to protect the inhabitants from war/bandits on the surface. Having a guide along with you can make the visit more interesting, and can help navigate the other large tour groups.	2019-10	4	4	1
826	826	One of 36	Great underground city. Obviously you can not see all the places thousands of people could live during times of unrest	2019-10	4	4	1
827	827	It's good. But if given chance, go to Derinkuyu	"Simply put, Kaymakli is much less ""adventurous"" than Derinkuyu. There are some tunnels and low ceilings here but never once you will have to bend and walk for prolonged amount of time. Certainly not for 5 minutes straight.If you have claustrophobia or any joint pains or you have physical problems in bending then this place is not for you. As far as history and overall configuration of the underground city is concerned, almost all the underground cities in Cappadocia area are similar. Do read about the history of these underground cities or ask your guide to explain in detail before you reach here. With proper history and perspective you will be able to appreciate the place much better."	2019-10	4	4	1
828	828	Underground	Interesting underground place. However there were a lot of people for such small space under the ground.	2019-10	4	4	1
829	829	Interesting	We went to Kaymakli late morning, lots of toutists and very small spaces, definately not for anyone who suffers from claustrophobia, especially with loads of people down there. If you don't mind lots of people and small spaces the history behind it is actually fascinating.	2019-09	4	4	0
830	830	Very impressive sight!	The scale of this underground city is really spectacular, especially considering most of it remains yet-to-be uncovered. I highly recommend touring with a guide,so that you will better understand the rooms you are seeing. Regardless, it was a fun place to wander.	2019-08	5	4	1
831	831	Amazing - not to be missed!	It is so incredible to see what was done to create these caves hundreds of years ago without any technology.  Just rough tools and sweat!	2019-09	5	4	1
832	832	wow!! history!!	breathtaking and stunning views and presentation👍👍👍beautiful place👍thanks for sharing it to the public.	2019-09	5	4	1
833	833	Great	Great underground city with 4 levels (depends who you count them).You can do this along but having a guide would help with the history, what each room/ feature is (although they have one or two signs per room, only mentioning the name of the room, e.g. winery or staple) and going into less known side rooms	2019-09	5	4	1
834	834	Amazing experience all round	What an amazing underground city that we were told dates back to 1200BC and was opened to the public in 1064.  It was used by the local people until the 13th century AD then was used for storage on the first couple of levels.  We got to see ventilation shafts, massive stone doors that roll to keep invaders out, a food storage room, as well as various other large rooms & smaller tunnels joining other rooms. You do go through narrow places where you have to bend down but the lighting is good.  Our guide gave us lots of information as we moved along.  Our tour took just over an hour.	2019-04	5	4	1
835	835	Great place and its so cool!	We were amazed when we entered the underground city since no one could make out that there is a city below us. Its hidden gems of Turkey. You will go below 9 stories and the place is so cool. The tunnels with cross manners are amazing. The place has good eateries, restrooms, and souvenir shops. The underground city is not wheelchair accesible.	2019-08	5	4	1
836	836	Amazing!	Can't think what happen in there, how to make it! Incredible story at every corner. Thinking live in there make you appreciate your life now and how hardly separate us with technology  nowdays.	2019-08	5	4	1
837	837	Great place to see and experience	It is very well maintained, ancient underground city that is very well worth to visit. If you are short in time, I'd suggest visiting this one over Derinkuyu underground city, since it is much better structured and explains more about the living from the old times. Highly recommend!	2019-08	5	4	1
838	838	Unique experience!	What a unique experience! I’d recommend you take a guided tour if you’re going to the underground city so you can appreciate all that you see more. Not for the claustrophobic as you will be required to walk through long and narrow tunnels. Try to visit when it is less if possible!	2019-08	5	4	1
839	839	Unique experience	Visiting this underground city was one of the most unique experiences we have had. It is fascinating to see how people could build such a thing and to use it as their shelter. There are several floors underground with different rooms. Very narrow stairs and hallways and a fascinating ventilation system. Comfy shoes and water bottles are recommended.	2019-07	5	4	1
840	840	Unbelievable Attraction	Fun to explore and best with a guide to explain the historical details.  Another must see in Turkey.Wish we had a little more time though, we felt rushed by our guide.	2018-10	4	4	1
841	841	AMAZING	It is amuuzing you will love it. My young jids 6 and 4 yeara old loved it too and were able to go dowb five floors below the ground. They were to understand the explanation of the guide. You must take the guide otherwise you will not understand the structures and what you are seeing. The guide was to take 100 lira if we are alone and 70 with another group.  You must go there. Highly recommended.	2019-08	5	4	0
842	842	Need a guide for a fuller appreciation	From the parking area, you must walk by a large number of shops to reach the entrance.  Admission is 35 lira, and there are four levels of the city currently open to visitors. There is a model of the city right beside the metal detector at the entrance. There are arrows on the walls to help you navigate into and back out of the city, but the only signs are occasional room names like “church” or “winery”. If you go with a guide, you will get a much greater understanding of how the residents lived in this maze of tunnels and rooms. There are quite a number of steps and some long passageways that require a person to bend their knees and back in order to pass by. This attraction is not for anyone that has issues with either or is claustrophobic.	2019-06	5	4	1
843	843	Great kaymakli	The most amazing and wounderful place I have visited all over the world, specialy when knowing the hestorical details of the city from the guidIt is realy a place that you shouldnt miss	2019-08	5	4	1
844	844	must visit for sure	not for claustrophobic people. this underground city is quite big, and a great adventure too. the region of cappadocia is famous for these underground cities. so if you want to choose one, this wont disappoint you.	2019-05	5	4	1
845	845	Simply amazing!	What an amazing place and history the underground city has. Our family thoroughly enjoyed our time here, and it was made all the richer by having our fabulous guide Eda with us for the day sharing all her knowledge. Highly recommend visiting, and if you can your experience will be that much better with a guide (you can find Eda on the Tours By Locals website - the best guide in Turkey!).	2019-07	5	4	1
846	846	An amazing walk through history	"Kaymakli is a ""must see"". Firstly, ensure that you have worn light clothes, are travelling light and wearing flat shoes. It would help to keep your elbows and knees covered just in case you scrape them. Be sure to secure the items your are carrying, lest they roll off. And then, take a long journey through this underground city - you will walk up and down slopes, crouch in tight passages - but its worth the effort, as you see different rooms - kitchens, living rooms, storage rooms, stables and more. The place is cool and dark, but added lighting helps. Having a guide is imperative if you really wish to know what each room or place was meant for or you will end up confused."	2019-06	5	4	1
847	847	Skipped the Green Tour, and did not regret	Asked my hotel to book me a taxi to drive us to and from, TL200 round-trip. Arrived around lunchtime and had the place completely to ourselves. Entry ticket was TL35 each. Was approached by an official guide, Levent, who proved to be very helpful and educational to enjoy the underground city, paid TL120. Note that there are numerous low ceilings so a bit of crouching is necessary.	2019-06	5	4	1
848	848	Cool	An amazing experience to see the underground city.  Mind you there are a lot of steps heading down and up with 3-4 feet height sometimes. Coming up could be a challenge for elderly.	2019-06	5	4	1
849	849	why did they build that?	underground world, strange, excited, hidden, something new for me, but very old in fact, narrow halls and low ceilings, yet very functional , fresh air coming from nowhere... why they needed that?	2019-07	4	4	1
850	850	Worth the visit	The walk 4 floors underground was quite interesting, interesting to see how they carved their living spaces in the ground and accommodated for things like ventilation etc... the walk was a tight squeeze at many points so if you’re claustrophobic I wouldn’t suggest going down.	2019-06	3	4	1
851	851	Interesting underground Walking activity	Part of our green tour activity. You wouldn’t believe that there is a huge city below you when you approached the entrance. If you like and have interest in way people live long time ago and under the ground, this is a must. If you can’t climb up and down a tight staircase easily, then maybe this will be hard for you. If you have a back problem, then it is difficult for you (unless you just want to stay in one of the big rooms and then come back up). If you are 6 month and up pregnant, forget it. Just stay out of it. Claustrophobia? Yea, you might need to reconsider as there were some tight space you have to go through, but not that long space.Other than that, enjoy it. It is something different than you’d normally see and do.,	2019-06	5	4	0
852	852	Extraordinary	A place you have to visit if you’re in cappadocia.It goes very deep underground you have to lower your body to go into the tunnels.	2019-06	5	4	0
853	853	One hour tour through a maze of small rooms and tunnels	The area can be very busy with tourgroups , so try to avoid the peak hours. The Guide Mustafa we had, was very nice and allowed some rushing tourgroups to pass, so we could appreciate the various side spaces without them being crowded. Illumination is excellent and holes in the floor are covered with laminated glass. Do not bring a bulky backpack as this will hinder you crawling through the passages. Only the top three levels are accessible, but interesting enough.	2019-06	5	4	1
854	854	Great experience	Went to the caves with a personal guide which enhanced our visit. Incredible to think that people lived in these caves. We went down to three levels. If someone is claustrophobic, they might have a bit of an issue with the narrow low passages in some areas.	2019-06	4	4	1
855	855	Interesting expetience. Very interesting history!!	There were 2 great aha's of this tour for us. The entire learning of how the cities were formed, volcanic activity in the area, and the entire history of how these cities came out to be inhabited. The tour lasts approx 45 minutes. Only 5-10% of the caves are open to public. One has to walk substantially, going 4-5 storey down. The alley is very narrow, and at times extremely shart in height. Which means people with physical issues, back problems etc will find it difficult to.undertake this activity. It gets very crowded Inside. The holding areas at every floor are really tint, and if you have a big group next to you - it can be extremely claustrophobic! Go early in the morning. If you don't have a tour, then hire a guide there!	2019-05	4	4	0
856	856	A must see	Another must see here at cappadocia. Early christians used this place to escape persecution. Very very nice and interesting place.	2019-06	5	4	1
857	857	The largest underground city	I visited Kaymakli last year after visiting Derinkuyu. While Derinkuyu is the deepest of the underground cities Kaymakli is the largest. This city is a lot easier to get around than Derinkuyu. The interesting thing is there is a 5-kilometer straight tunnel between Kaymakli and Derinkuyu which is not accessible to the tourist. If you visit these cities you notice that the upper levels are over 7 feet high. the initial people who built them must have been very tall.	2018-07	5	4	1
858	858	Caves built from volcanic rock	Really amazing to see the underground city. People with knee problem might find it a problem navigating inside the tunnel.Understand there are 8 floors below ground level but only the first floor is open to the public.	2019-04	4	4	1
859	859	Amazing City	Underground city!! 8 storied. The guide climed 1 sqkm in size. Must listen to the story. Take a guide. Naturally air conditioned inside. Witness 1st class, 2nd class and 3rd class floors according to the status of the people who lived at that time. Recommending to take a guide after bargaining.	2018-08	5	4	1
860	860	I don't think a guide is definitely needed	Unlike other reviews, I don't think hiring a guide is essential to have a good experience. If you don't want to hire one, just make sure to read a bit ahead of time, various travel blogs talk about it. Reading those and reviews here, I'd say 80-90% of what the guide told us I already knew. The downside of having a guide is the cost (initially he said 120 lira though I negotiated to 80 and then tiped to 100) but more importantly, the guides kinda rush you. Without a guide, it'd be neat to explore and discover things at your own pace. There are labels of pretty much everything the guide pointed out, just no description or explanations. Tl,dr: a guide is worth it, but if you want a bit more time and independence, read ahead so you know what you're looking at.	2019-05	5	4	1
861	861	Offers a wonderful opportunity to see how people lived	Kaymakli Underground City - An opportunity to view first-hand the way early Christians lived. Spread over the depth of 7 levels, out of which 4 are open to visitors, this underground city has everything its dwellers needed - stables, tunnel doors, church, wineries, cellars, larders, kitchens, bedrooms, stairways, a ventilation shaft, workshops, and even graves, some of which are left excavated along with the skeletons!	2019-04	5	4	1
862	862	So neat!	We drove here ourselves from our hotel in Goreme. We arrived around 1:30 and there was not many bus crowds yet so it was great timing for us. The cost to park 5tl and 35tl admission. Red arrows guide your path to the 4th or 5th level of the caves- they are amazing. Thank goodness for the arrows because it would be easy to get turned around. Once you reach as far as it is open to the public, follow the blue arrows to the exit. We did this in about half an hour to avoid crowds that were starting to come in (it gets much less enjoyable to spend time in the cramped corridors when bus loads of people are also coming at you).Highly recommend a stop here!	2019-05	5	4	0
863	863	Not so impresivs	We have walked a lot, to much upstairs, its not so impresive. For people who love architecture they can learn a lot	2019-05	3	4	1
864	864	Must visit!	Amazing architecture and the actual size of it is just unbelievable. You only get to see about 15% of the actual size and that in itself is a lot.	2019-04	5	4	1
865	865	It is in my list top 3 attractions of Cappadocia region	The underground cave city was built nearly 2800 years ago under a hill known as citadel of Kaymakli. It is believed that there are 36 underground cities in Cappadocia, but the widest one is in KaymakliWhile the underground city is 8 floors below ground level only the first floors are open to public. Not to be missed on a visit to Cappadocia	2019-04	5	4	0
866	866	Wondering how thousands of people lived in this cave city	There are many underground cities in Cappadocia. But the Kayamakli is the largest. Though there are many floors in this city, only four floors are now open for public and it is enough to give an idea of this another wonders in Cappadocia. The whole place is well lit and fairly well ventilated so there are no worries of going down four floors for the visit but must hire a proper guide for explanation of different areas as signage are poor. The ventilation shafts (a real marvellous idea), a winery, the massive stone doors, a food storage room, and various other large rooms and small tunnels are very fascinating to watch. One may wonder how so many people were living in such rooms connected with narrow tunnels. Most of the tunnels are wide enough and with reasonable height to pass through, but one tunnel was really very narrow and height was low. Especially for tall bald headed people it is recommended to wear a cap so that head doesn’t get bruised while passing through low height tunnels. We had back problem and initially little sceptical in entering the underground city, but we could manage it without crawling and now we think that this risk was worth. So don’t miss this fascinating underground city if you are in Cappadocia.	2018-06	5	4	0
867	867	Do not miss it! Kacirmayin!	One of the most impressive spots of the area, never seen anything like it before. Totally worth the time and the fee.pay attention if you are claustrophobic.Hayatimda gordugum en etkileyici yerlerdendi, kacirilmamali.kapali alan korkunuz varsa girmeyin.	2019-04	5	4	1
868	868	Underground City	Fun, wonderful and special place to be. Must see to appreciate this underground city. Learned that it is estimated 13 million years ago, this place was occupied by civilians for miles and miles underground. Food was stored after harvested, wine was made in the winery, there was a church, air ducts were made for ventilation. This is a wonderful place to visit. Must see!	2019-03	5	4	1
869	869	UNDERGROUND CITY	The Derinkuyu underground city (Cappadocian Greek: Μαλακοπή) is an ancient multi-level underground city in the Derinkuyu district in Nevşehir Province, Turkey. Extending to a depth of approximately 60 metres (200 ft), it is large enough to have sheltered as many as 20,000 people together with their livestock and food stores. It is the largest excavated underground city in Turkey and is one of several underground complexes found across Cappadocia.	2018-11	4	4	1
870	870	Hire a guide!!	This place will be better appreciated wd a guide. To help you with directions and also tell you stories abt the rooms...it would be a waste of time wdout a guide. We jst met ours when we went in.	2019-01	5	4	1
871	871	Jaw dropping underground civilisation	Must do attraction wit a knowledgeable guide, we hired one for 70liras who explained this very well for around 1.5 hours and took us to maximum allowable depth.Please make sure you can bend, crouching well as you will do a lot here. Lotsa big groups and noisy guides so you can request your guide to wait till they pass. Request not to take non-recommended routes inside as we saw a lady with her knee hurt.Technology at its peak to survive there especially those ‘telephone’ holes. Be amazed to see this marvellous settlement and hear their stories.	2018-12	5	4	1
872	872	WOW	I just have to say wow! It was so cool and so big. You can see everything and I really liked it. I would not recommend to take with small childs that you have to carry. I carried my 2 year old daugther and it was hard. It is very small sometimes and sometimes you have to sit down to move.It was a good workout	2019-01	5	4	1
873	873	Interesting but hire one of the guides	Fascinating! We've been here twice with different family members and loved it both times. Can be a little physically challenging for some - there's a lot of tunnels and narrow passageways. Highly recommend taking up the offer of the tour guides at the entrance - there is almost no info displayed once you enter and our guide Levent is a wealth of knowledge on how the city worked. My husband's done it once with no guide and regretted not hiring the guide! At Dec 2018 the cost of a private tour was only 100 lira for the group of us. Well worth it.Also if you are a resident of Turkey and have the Muzekart+, entrance is included for free when you present your card.	2018-12	5	4	1
874	874	Nice place	The place is very nice to see - just think twice before you take a small child with you because there are some very small passages we had to take out our baby carried out in the middle of the one of these passages.	2018-12	4	4	0
875	875	Unbelievable cities that existed Thousands of years earlier	We understood that these troglodyte cave-cities existed centuries of years ago and were excavated as early as Hittite times, and expanded over the centuries as various marauding armies traversed Central Anatolia in search of captives and plunder. There are 36 underground cities in Cappadocia and the deepest one is in Derinkuyu underground city, while the widest is the Kaymakli Underground City. We visited the Kaymakli underground city. It contains all the usual rooms found in an underground city (stables, cellars, storage rooms, refectories, churches, wineries etc.) It is unlikely that the underground cities were ever intended for permanent dwelling, or even long stays, but they were clearly built to withstand attack and could support large numbers of people and their domestic animals, for extended periods of time.  These extensive networks of passages, tunnels and inclined corridors linked family rooms and communal spaces where people would meet, work and worship. The cities were complete with wells, chimneys for air circulation, niches for oil lamps, stores, water tanks, stables and areas where the dead could be placed until such time as conditions on the surface would allow their proper disposal. Most importantly, carefully balanced moving stone doors, resembling mill stones, were devised to quickly block the corridors in the event of an attack. Of course, these doors operated from one side only!	2018-12	5	4	1
876	876	A great experience	We came early before the crowd and have the chance to do a leisurely tour.  It is a great experience as we walked slowly to different parts of the caves.  It is amazing to see how they store their food and wines.  Our guide provided us with good information.  A must do activity.	2018-12	5	4	1
877	877	Not my idea of fun	This was an extremely claustrophobic experience for me. The underground city gets too crowded with large tourist groups getting in. As people pause to pose for pictures, the narrow passages get choked and queue fulls of other visitors are left waiting, often in crouched position under low ceilings. I wouldn't recommend this visit.	2018-10	3	4	1
878	878	a great experience to see the wisdom from thousands of years ago!	It was the second stop of the green tour, the place was actually quite busy that day, several groups were stopping by, and unfortunately we did not have the time to go deeper to level 7 or 8, as we need to keep on our schedule , still a good experience though. The underground city was much bigger than I thought, the tunnels were basically very narrow and low, I am 168cm tall and I was almost doing a 90 degree bend when going through those tunnels, but the ceiling was just as normal houses in the living rooms and dorm and the churches after you go through the tunnels. It was kind funny to keep making noise when we were in the long tunnel, so as to let people on the other side hear it and won’t come in and avoid the “traffic”, the tunnels are mostly only one person wide.It was also quite interesting to see how people from thousands of years ago use their wisdom and teamwork to build this settlement, including how they separate the functions of each level, how they design the door, how they connect each section, how they make sure they get water and fresh air and keep this place from bad smelling, and the toilet solution etc. The guide definitely made this stop much more of its value and enhanced your experience, it is quite far from the Goreme town as well, so would rather recommend to go with a guide or in a tour, so that you can understand the stories. There is a washroom outside the entrance and it is free.There is a museum shop by the entrance as well, but our guide told us it is overpriced.there are places close to the parking lot where you can buy a tea or squeezed juice.overall a must go!	2018-11	5	4	0
879	879	Must See	I'm a little embarrassed giving this a 4 rating, as it is a remarkable site and everyone should see it.  It has 8 stories underground with a full city, including churches, stores, stables, etc. I guess the '4' is only because Kaymakli is a victim of it's own success. The single pathway through the city was a stream of tour group after tour group and, often times, your guide is finished in your area but the tour guide in the next area is still talking, so you wait. And, often, you are in one of the 5' hi corridor so you're scrunched over while you're waiting.	2018-11	4	4	1
880	880	The Underground!!	This place is not meant for all. Fascinating place to visit. The way the caves were dug out and the explanations from the guide on how people lived here on a day to day basis is really fascinating. There are 4 levels. The 1st level is ok and does not involve much bending and wriggling thru tunnels. However level 3 & 4 is quite narrow and trying to get thru the tunnels is quite a task if you are not fit enough. However would recommend visiting. We visited with our parents who made it to level 1 but turned back seeing the narrow tunnels. Hoever there was plenty of shopping  outside to keep them busy/	2018-10	5	4	1
881	881	Totally 'Wow'	Amazing underground cave city - has to be a must-see. Dug by hand hundreds (thousands?) of years ago, and a labyrinth of tunnels and rooms which goes down multiple levels. I believe there are 10 levels in all, but you can only visit the top 5 levels - which is enough believe me. Absolutely a high-point of our visit to the Cappadocia region.	2018-10	5	4	0
882	882	Loved this place!	This is a fabulous place, there are 5 levels / floors open to the public, expect small tunnels to crouch through and uneven steps, proper little rabbits warren.	2018-10	5	4	0
883	883	Wow	Amazing experience to go underground and imagine the lives of the people who created this underground city with houses and churches, kitchens and ventilation shafts.  Narrow passageways and stairs.  great experience.	2018-07	5	4	1
884	884	Hard to imagine how they built it.	It's amazing to see what people do and how they lived in an underground citiy hundreds of years ago.	2018-10	4	4	0
885	885	not for everyone	The tunnel is narrow and low. You have to bend down and even walk with bent kneels, not for 1 or 2 meters, but 20.  The air inside is not stuffy, but with a large group, you can imagine the feeling. Light is enough for the whole journey (opened to tourist for 20 minutes walk), which is only a very small part of the tunnels linking this huge underground city. If you are not claustrophobia, it is interesting to learn the life underground, especially when enemies are looking for you above.	2018-09	3	4	1
886	886	Amazing	It’s amazing to think that these underground cities were built without construction machinery. Extending several floors into the ground, they provided a safe harbour for the population during conflict, with sophisticated ventilation shafts and complete with kitchens, stables, wineries and churches. Do go and see for yourself	2018-09	5	4	0
887	887	Interesting visit	This if u are in the city of cappadocia Then I do recommend a visit to this site but only with a guide We had a very good guide that we were able to spend about an hour explaining the history and uses of each room This is to be honest the 1st  underground city that I have been too where the Christians has to use to escapes the Romans that were trying to kill them A lot of very interesting things to see for me but I can imagine if u are trying to visit this without guide	2018-10	4	4	1
888	888	Very small place	At first it was interesting but in the middle of the underground city i felt very bad. The tunnel is very small, there were a lot of people and there was no air. I got panicked. It was the first time in my life that made me feel scared in a small place. I do not recommend it for claustrophobics.	2018-09	1	4	0
889	889	Amazing city, not as hard on the knees as Derinkuyu underground city	This one enters horizontally into the side of a hill, so there is a lot less climbing needed, but there are still many low ceilings in corridors.It's stunning, don't miss the chance to visit thisAlso: for all these, get the 75 Turkish Lira museum card, that gets you into all the local museums	2018-09	5	4	0
890	890	Cool tourguide	I would definitely recommend this place to visit. We arrived here with my husband only the two of us, and even so we got a private tour with a very cool tour guide, who spoke very good English. He knew a lot about the place and told us very interesting facts about the ancient times, when these underground cities were built. We had fun and enjoyed our visit, thank you!	2018-07	5	4	1
891	891	Awesome Site	The underground city is a very interesting site, and definitely worth a visit. The entrance fee is minimal and its fascinating to understand how people lived in these conditions. Tourists will have plenty of opportunities for some great photos and outside of the city local vendors sell home made crafts.	2018-09	4	4	1
892	892	Part to tour	I agreed that you should contact hotel to book a day tour for you which is cost almost the same ( i believed)	2018-09	4	4	1
893	893	Definitely a place to visit	A great to place to visit and especially with a guide. The guides have a good historical background and also the locals have their own experience of staying in the caves. The architecture and the thought process of building was top notch.	2018-08	5	4	1
894	894	Most Interesting place	This place is most interesting when visited with a guide. This is not to promote guides but it makes sense to get the story about why and what. Otherwise you just run around underground. Also the indications are somewhat different they change somewhere from Red arrows to Blue arrows. If you get confused it can take some time to get out	2018-09	4	4	1
895	895	Better than derinkuyu	I liked kaymakli much more better than derinkuyu. It is more fun to walk around see all the rooms in there.  Both underground cities are close to each other, better seeing both it will take max 2-3 hours.	2018-09	5	4	1
896	896	Guided tour	Highly recommended for a guided tour - it was part of our package and we kind of liked it. Without a guide, it would be tough to understand the details about the history and design. It would be fun to go around the city and learn about the history.	2018-08	5	4	1
897	897	very nice visit	its unique visit you should do it but take care if you have klistophobia the air quality is not great inside the city and it has quite a lot of steps	2018-08	5	4	1
898	898	8th wonder of the world	This is a must visit activity in this area.The work people have done over the centuries make you wonder about human spirit and what it can achieve.Once you are inside,you really appreciate human edurance and what is possible!	2018-08	5	4	1
899	899	Interesting adventure.	Overall a unique experience for those who’ve never been inside a cave/underground tunnels before. Getting to see the rooms/places where people used to take refuge in/live in was really humbling.Not suitable for those with bad back/knees as some tunnels require extreme bending of the back/crawl to access.	2018-07	4	4	0
900	900	Great if you would like to pin-point the exact location of any dormant claustrophobia you may carry inside you	It is however not an uninteresting site by any means.Depending on the accuracy of the information flooded on me by resident freelance guide Mustafa, the dimensions and peak population of this place were impressive. More so after visiting.Tall, and as is my case, allround BIG, visitors might find the fit of the caves and passages to be rather too tight for comfort. The ceilings are mostly below 180cm and some of the passages considerably lower.It is interesting from a historical point of view - but if pressed for time I think I'd opt for more over-ground attractions. I personally like to take photos and find the outdoor vistas more rewarding than the underground city.Useful reminder that UNESCO does not select sites based on their  attractiveness for tourism	2018-07	3	4	1
901	901	Definelty yes	I did write a view about this place under Derinkuyu. It was definetly amazing and big, well worth the visit and the money.  If you like to take you time to wonder around you can, or you can just follow the arrows they put inside the place.  Must see.	2018-07	5	4	1
902	902	Awesome!	We loved visiting here! It's amazing to think people lived down there, I can't get over it. Such an incredible and cool place. The only thing I could think of that would be a benefit is iif there was some kind of technology where people would know if they were coming up/down the tunnels lol. I know it's part of the experience but yelling in different languages was a little tough. Maybe a little green/red button or something! Definitely recommend the visit! Also, there's a little shop that's across the street I suggest you visiting too! The man practically gives it away for free (soooo cheap) and has really cool vintage things!	2018-07	5	4	1
903	903	Tunnels	This city is spread out via numerous tunnels, some are low and narrow. It is possibly the only time I’m grateful for being short. You may want to get a guide if you want to know the history but otherwise you can pretty much guide yourself through if you just follow the coloured arrows.	2018-06	4	4	1
904	904	Goosebumps	Even if this is a little bit out of the way, we still decided to go anyway. and we were not disappointed. It's remarkable to see bits of history, all the more something as big as this underground city. Our guide was knowledgeable. He presented himself to us at the entrance to offer his services. Haggling is allowed and we believe we got a good deal after learning it all from him. Without a guide, it would not have been as effective, which is why I give it a 4  instead of a 5. I like taking my time and wandering about and still knowing the relevance of a historical site. I suggest that the team come up with an downloadable audio-guide so we can see the place on our own.	2018-06	4	4	1
905	905	Cool place for visit	This place is well maintain and well lighted. You could do self guide walking tour or hires a guide with you. Most tourists there are Chinese tour groups, so don’t be offended if heard loud voice or someone did not followed public orders.Check the history online before you go, it is a interesting place for a short stop.	2018-07	4	4	1
906	906	Need a guide	This city is so cool! Do pay for a guide outside the city to fully enjoy the experience! The price for a guide is generally 59 lira.	2018-06	5	4	1
907	907	The things people do	The things people had to do thousands of years ago to survive . . . and, likewise, the things you have to do to visit the site. Not for the claustrophobic, but does that not add to the experience ? The fact that these people dug out holes way deep underground, where oxygen is low and the roof is lower , what survival instincts !I think this site proves the resilience of humans and is of enormous historical significance. The visitors who complain about the low & narrow tunnels obviously do not understand this.The site is well presented, but I recommend visiting with a guide.	2018-05	4	4	1
908	908	Must see when in cappadocia	This is an underground city carved out by the early christians who lived here to hide. The place also provides insulation and protection from extreme weather. It is an amazing place and architectural marvel which dates back thousands of years. A must see when in cappadocia.	2018-05	5	4	1
909	909	Unbelievable site	Amazing site and unbelievable stories behind it. A must visit place if you are in Cappadocia. Also it is not very well suited you are claustrophobic	2018-04	5	4	1
910	910	Something out of the ordinary, could be developed more	First, I'd like to note that this underground city will not be good for claustrophobic visitors. My husband had to go back out to the entrance early on in the tour. The operator also cautions against people who have asthma or heart conditions -- I broke a sweat while walking back up several sets of stairs and spending much of the visit crouched / bent over at the waist. I'm 63 inches tall (160 cm), so this wasn't a huge inconvenience for me. However, the number of long, narrow tunnels could be a problem for anyone very tall or otherwise large in size.Appropriate dress: Though it was cooler underground than outside, the activity and large number of people in proximity had me sweating. Anyone who feels chilly easily might want to wear a light jacket or pants. Comfortable, flat shoes are strongly recommended for the uneven floors and narrow tunnels. I also recommend not carrying in cumbersome items, like floppy hats, large DSLR camera lens, tripods because they'll be hard to maneuver around in the tunnels, or things that may roll away (toy cars, balls) as they may disappear down an inaccessible tunnel.I really enjoyed looking around the underground city and its various features, trying to imagine how life must have been for people who hid in these cities for their safety. The confusing maze of tunnels must have taken time to get used to, and people who lived there probably got lost easily, considering the size of this city and the way the tunnels tend to look similar.I did not have a tour guide, though I was behind two tour groups and was able to hear some of the information those guides shared with their group. I agree that additional information (such as a guide, signs, or an audio tour) would enrich the visitor experience.One thing that surprised me is that the underground city is simply hollowed-out spaces. I expected staged scenes using mannequins in period costumes with props or actual relics from their time (much like the staged scenes you can find in many ethnographic museums in Turkey). This would have helped bring these empty rooms to life and shown us better what daily life was like in these unusual quarters, what challenges the people might have experienced, and how various room features (holes in the ground, holes carved into the walls) were actually used.  My husband suggested that animatronics might also be more interesting or helpful, but I believe simple mannequins would have done the job.We happened to arrive at the same time as a very large school group and two foreign tour groups, which didn't help alleviate the cramped feeling. However, we let the groups enter before us, and this allowed us to explore more comfortably. We could get a better sense of how the spaces must have felt to the former refugees living there.One safety issue is that some lighting fixtures were embedded into the ground. Visitors need to check the ground frequently while walking because the ground is uneven inside the caves, plus there were sometimes unexpected short steps of varying sizes (1-2 steps) in corridors or leading from rooms into larger open areas --  anyone who is looking downward to be sure of their footing is temporarily blinded by the lights installed in the ground and may miss a step or uneven spot. The lights on the walls worked better for lighting the way.	2018-05	4	4	1
911	911	Fascinating but make sure to have a guide	This was a very interesting tour but not for the faint-hearted. You need to make sure you have a good guide to explain the intracacies of what is where. It is best to go later in the day when it is less busy. We let a couple of tours go ahead of us so that we would not feel crowded or hassled to keep moving and that was a real benefit. I would hate to see it at the peak holiday period. At times the passages are very narrow and low so you need to be able to bend low whilst walking. An hour is sufficient to see most of what you need to in order to get a good idea of the life of the cave-dwellers.	2018-04	5	4	1
912	912	Interesting experience	It was a rather amazing experience to tour the underground city - we were part of a tour group and so had a guide with us to explain along the way (where the winery is, the kitchen, ventilation, etc). However, this is not recommended for the elderly who have weak knees and back issues, as there are a couple of steep and narrow passages whereby you will have to bend down and walk a considerable distance.	2018-04	5	4	1
913	913	Incredible	This underground city is located 9km away from the Derinkuyu.I love this place as it amazed me with the complex passages and tunnel.There were a lot of tourists when I get there which made me feel uncomfortable exploring the narrow passages of the city.But it is the good place to visit anyway :)	2018-04	5	4	1
914	914	Amazing Underground City - Turkey Museum Pass Accepted	When under siege, locals from the 8th to 7th centuries began to move their families and their livestock underground. There are kitchens, churches and lots of wine storage areas-they had to have something to entertain themselves. The volcanic rock is comparatively easy to chisel, and the people made the most of that by widening and creating more rooms, air shafts and hallways. Anyone made nervous by very tight passageways might want to visit the many stalls outside.	2018-04	5	4	1
915	915	Well worth 25tl	We caught the local bus from Goreme town to Nevsehir then changed to the local bus to the under ground city.  It's just off the main road and easy to find.  Once your in a local guide will ask if your like a tour.  It's very quick but from what we heard gives you some basic information ( we skipped the tour ). If you take the tour redo the caves.  We explored in parts all over that the guide will miss.   We climbed , crawled through tunnels up & down and just kept going for two hours.  What a place to visit.  Recommend that you take good pair of walking shoes and remember it's dirty down there.  Well okay dusty.  There is another under ground city just another 10 km down the road ( we didn't do thou ) so it's possible to do both.  Lots of cafes nearby if you need a break.	2018-04	5	4	1
916	916	Spectacular place	As this was completely new experience for me I was very impressed by this underground city. Our guide said it is 8 floors deep but only 4 are open to the public. Honestly, once inside you kind of don't know what floor you are on. It goes up and down all the time. There are blue and red arrows that you can follow. One of the takes you deeper and the other one takes you out to the surface. There is no way you can get lost if you follow the arrows. The place is crowded with big groups and it is quite annoying because group guides kind of rush you. At some point I decided to get away from my own group and take my time in there, it was a good decision. The underground city is very interesting and you can easily spend 1 - 1:30h in there.	2018-04	5	4	1
917	917	Very interesting but organise a guide in advance!	A well set up tourist experience, and a very interesting insight into the lives of the cave-dwellers who once lived there!There is no information available, so a guide is essential. This is best organised in advance as if organised at the time, the group size can be large and the guide often has to explain everything in several languages.A tour takes around 30minutes minimum.	2018-04	5	4	1
918	918	This is Spectacular	This is a beautiful underground city situated in Cappadocia. If you are visiting Cappadocia, this is a must place to visit. It goes 7 floors down and people can go upto 5 floors. Its dark down there and the path is narrow. I loved the city and the way it is made. The living room, the storage room, etc.	2018-02	5	4	1
919	919	Wow!	The underground cities in Cappadocia were excavated as early as Hittite times. Kaymakli was opened to visitors in 1964. I would strongly recommend a guided tour, as it would seem easy enough to get lost. For those of you (like myself) who are claustrophobic, walking stooped over for short periods of time and in narrow quarters can be daunting, but the people in my group were understanding and supported me all the way.  (Hint:  it helps to follow someone and concentrate on something that person is wearing, for example, a kind man went ahead of me with his knapsack, which had a bright yellow sticker on which I could concentrate.  I don't know why but it works). Four of the eight floors are open to the public, and include the stable, church, storage places, wineries and kitchen. Incredible to think the amount of time and effort that went into the construction, and that people led their lives underground for extended periods of time.	2018-03	5	4	0
920	920	Cool city, tour not for everyone	We took a guided tour through the underground city which was great as one could get lost down there. This tour is not for you if you have claustrophobia, are not fit enough to walk short distances hunched over or have trouble with stairs. Also of you are obese you may not fit through some of the passages. Without the guide we would have missed many things. Very cool and good to see at least once in your life.	2018-03	4	4	1
